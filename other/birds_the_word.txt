Toucan do it, not one
You think I can;t? The pell-ican't!


Stephen Seagal, Drake, the Flaming-o Lips

Concluding pun on the early bird getting the worm
	he teleported => the early bird catches the wormhole
	took a shortcut along the river => the early bird catches the berm

....

So a little bird told me this story... but owl sparrow you the details. The weather's quite pheasant
on this Hawk-tober day in Phoenix. There's a footrace going on, with a full rooster of competitors.
They stand at the starling line. The ref cocks his ibis-tol, says "on your lark," and flyers! Hen
they're off!

Stephen Seagull wren like he was robin someone. Drake was quite the roadrunner; he's no rook-ie.

Matthew Macaw-naughey had a stork of bad cluck: he passed a crane, but wasn't casso-wary enough,
didn't duck in time, and hit it her-on. After pidgeon forward and warbling back and forth, he lost
too much time. His goose was cooked. He groused about it, but he said "no egrets" and emu-ved on --
it wasn't that bad of a mallardy.

Jay-Z was running swift-ly, but took a wrong tern and is flamin-go out! It blew-Jay's chances, but
he swallowed his pride and kept running.

John Oli-bird was stopped by a fissure in the ground, such a huge fissure it was a kingfissure!

Feather back, there's no dove lost between Stephen Gull-bert and the Roc:
"The Roc thinks you're too chicken to do this."
"That's cuckoo! If you can I toucan."
"What a cheep shot, dodo."
"The pell-i-can't win this!"
"No falcon way. The Roc says that part'-ridge."

But look! Idris Albatross is coming from behind. it's the rhea deal folks! He's e-quail with
Condor-leeza Rice! He's thrushing past Vi-owl-a Davis! He's bunting Kiwi Herman to second place!
It's all plover now... AND HE PASSES THE FINCH LINE!!! The buzzard has sounded. The crow-d goes
wild!

Asked how he won, he said "I'll talk turkey with you. My cardinal rule's to take the first grassy path I
see, and it turned out to be a huge shortcut."

The moral of the story is the early berm gets the word.

Condor-leeza Rice, Idris Albatross, or Kiwi Herman
