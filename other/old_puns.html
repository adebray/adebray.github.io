<p>I was once on a subway train whose last stop was at that city's airport, making it a terminal station.</p>

<p>Douglas Hofstadter once gave a talk about linguistic categories, with the idea that linguistic units give us categories of situations/contexts to which they apply.<br>
So at some point, Hofstadter must have come up with this concept and realized that it was important for him to share it with the world. This was his categorical imperative.</p>

<p>Recently, I put some bubble wrap on the wall outside my room for people to pop. People have begun added to the collection, so that people can always pop it when they're stressed.<br>
Yesterday, a big sheet of really good bubble wrap just... appeared. Does anyone know who put it there so I can thank them?<br>
...It's been a long time since I've felt this pop-ular.</p>
<p>When I, long ago, learned that the Nutcracker suite was written to be danced to, I said, "Aha! That is why there are so many movements."</p>
<p>"I have a friend who chases diagrams in much the same way that he chases women: by figuring out how they commute, and then carefully following them down every possible path."</p>
<p>"I'm addicted to sending letters through the mail. It started out as a regular expression of my appreciation of my friends, but it's reached a state where the mailman is rejecting my letters until I finally decide to halt and function more normally.<br>

<p>Would a particularly innovative way of beginning construction of a building be considered groundbreaking?</p>
<p>So this one time I tried my hand at web design and HTML, but I ended up being really out of my element.</p>
<p>I once heard of some spies who used a code language that didn't distinguish between active and passive voice. I guess that's why they called themselves secret agents.</p>
<p>I once heard of two prolific criminals who somehow never said anything during a heist. Even when caught by the police, they confessed with hand gestures and facial expressions.<br>
Anyways, I guess they're locked in a very real box now, but before that they were partners in mime.</p>
<p>I recently got a phone charger that came with several twist-ties to help organize the mess of cables around my power outlet. I thought it was awfully cordial of them to help battle the discord that usually goes on there.</p>

<p>"That song, much like a salad, could really benefit by throwing in some beats."</p>
<p>Today I saw two people who had started a chess game, made six or seven moves each, and then got distracted by their phones. It was a classic example of arrested development.</p>

<p>I've always had a hard time drawing fish accurately, perhaps because I have no sense of scale.</p>
<p>"Do you know why the third floor of this building's so much larger than the second?"
"Um, that's kind of a long story."</p>
<p>"Look, I appreciate you baking the bread instead of me for once, but how incompetent do you have to be to get the crust on the inside!?"<br>
"Don't you see? it's a roll reversal!"</p>
<p>In The Wizard of Oz, the coroner of Munchkin Land is seen examining the Wicked Witch of the East, but never bills anyone for his time, which is weird because I guess it's his job. Do you think that, this time only, it was on the house?</p>
<p>Backpacking isn't a competitive sport; it's just relaxing and fun. It would be so weird to see televised college backpacking competitions, with announcers reporting the latest Pack-12 results...</p>
<p>"So you're saying... we have the same shoe size, and we both really like the taste of flatfish. Does that make us sole mates?"</p>
<p>I feel like there's a lot more gossip about romance and potential couples around the holidays. Do you think people are making use of free shipping?</p>
<p>"He sees you when you're sleeping, he knows when you're awake..."<br>
"Oh my gosh, Santa's... stocking me!"</p>
<p>"Look, we don't need to divide up Grandfather's pet rabbits in the will. You're splitting hares!"</p>
<p>I guess journalists tend to have pressing concerns.</p>
<p>I wonder how much hip-hop is produced in Budapest. It could be a great Hungarian rap city.</p>
<p>It could be a lot of fun to doodle on the backs of playing cards. Though I guess they're not well suited to being decked out.</p>
<p>I once knew someone who always gave people alarm clocks on their birthdays, explaining that "there's no present like the time."</p>

<p>To all those of you with open-book CS finals this week, I hope that you pass by reference!</p>
<p>Apparently, I have a vested interest in investing in some kinds of formal outerwear.</p>
<p>I suppose that rock-climbing courses taught at universities are a form of higher education.</p>
<p>I now understand why people like murder-mystery themed dinners so much. The food is to die for, and in the end everyone gets their just desserts!</p>
<p>"Why do you always use such flavorful language in your speech?"<br>
"Because of how often I end up eating my own words."</p>
<p>A bipartisan bill legalizing medical marijuana for use in alleviating symptoms of arthritis would be joint support for joint support for joint support.</p>

<p>As hard times hit the jelly factory, executives found themselves in a jam, and ended up canning a lot of workers, who would later describe the experience as "jarring."</p>

<p>It's fun to imagine headlines of the future.<br>

<p>"Hey, did you know the automatic faucet isn't working?"<br>
"I've got a sinking feeling about this."</p>
<p>I wonder if anyone's ever applied machine learning to discovering the optimal competitive Pokémon strategy. There would of course be no shortage of training data.</p>
<p>Police were puzzled by a string of break-ins in which two shadowy figures broke into houses, wrote sonnets on the walls, and then left... taking nothing.<br>
After they were caught, they explained that they were partners in rhyme.</p>

<p>A teacher who wanted to assign grades fairly in a multivariable calculus class might end up doing some impartial differentiation.</p>
<p>I know a group of people who tried to teach themselves how to dye hair without any previous experience. It ended up being the blond leading the blond.</p>
<p>I used to think that the Bengali word for color was 'barna,' but it turned out to be wrong.</p>
<p>I wonder if a lot of Stanford graduates end up working at Apple, under the logic that the Apple doesn't fall far from the Tree.</p>
<p>I wonder if the executive board of any major bank operates under a system of checks and balances.</p>
<p>"So this one time, my Scout troop was going camping in the desert and a kid somehow accidentally kicked a cholla cactus!"<br>
"I take it he was a Tenderfoot?"</p>
<p>I had noticed that the math department tends to order Chinese food at a lot of its events (e.g. speaker series), and I never really knew why -- until I learned about the Chinese Remainder Theorem.</p>
<p>I once golfed with a man who brought a flask full of something fruity, and opened and drank it all before teeing off at the third hole.<br>
He explained that it was his "three-hole punch."</p>
<p>Why do Linux programmers make such bad statisticians?<br>
Because to them, there is no one normal distribution.</p>
<p>I love Vietnamese food, but I know nothing about the associated dining etiquette -- which means it's only a matter of time until I slip up and make a major pho pas.</p>
<p>Some people think that men's fashion ought to allow for handbags, and that otherwise it's too impurseonal.</p>

<p>While it's not quite the Axess of Evil, I think the redesign is a bit Axessive for not actually changing anything meaningful.</p>
<p>From the first day of filming, when three people turned up to play the weatherman, it was clear that his part had been overcast.</p>
<p>Apparently I view the Stanford course catalog through a Marxist lens, because it's class conflicts as far as I can see.</p>
<p>Under the standard rules of the board game Go, how many possible games are there? I think it would be reasonable to call this (very large) number the Go Cardinal.</p>
<p>I knew a guy who was very good at competitive sushi-eating; he won contest after contest. I guess he was really on a roll. He told me that he was so successful because he had learned to just roll with it.</p>
<p>Little boats ask their parents, "do you believe in ferries?"</p>

<p>Two weeks of touring with the Stanford Symphony Orchestra has been an incredible amount of fun, but I'm so tired I think I might fall into a state of tour-por.</p>
<p>I know someone whose textbooks suddenly all fell apart while he was studying. He suddenly found himself in a bit of a bind -- but concluded it was bound to happen eventually.</p>
<p>I once heard of a monk who was expelled from a monastery after the other monks made a laundry list of all of his bad habits.</p>
<p>"Why did you mark points off of my essay for the type of margin I used? It's completely unjustified!"</p>
<p>There are some door locks which are extremely narrow, apparently as security measure so that lockpickers only find slim pickings.</p>

<p>I know a man who claimed to be an expert at making omelets. When we discovered he was lying, he really had egg on his face.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to have a Unix shell called Blue Shell, in which multithreading is difficult to implement.<br>
...then, it would create race conditions, of course.</p>
<p>It seems that the best way to implement a just-in-time compiler is to procrastinate on the CS 143 assignments until shortly before they are due...</p>
<p>An apprentice to a very overweight baker might end up seeing him as a roll model.</p>
<p>If a marching band is playing in a parade, it might be useful to know how long the parade block is, for purposes of timing and the like. I don't know if anyone's given this number a name, but I suggest calling it the bandwidth.</p>
<p>The last time I played chess, I lost both of my bishops quickly, leading to defeat. I guess you would call that a clerical error?</p>
<p>People who lockpick tend to be very quiet about it... so quiet, in fact, that when they're picking you can hear a pin drop.</p>
<p>I had wondered why Bill seemed to be the only computer programmer in the entire Pok&eacute;mon world... until I realized the rest of them are probably registered as Bug Catchers.</p>

<p>In particle physics, people refer to antiprotons, but can't you get the same semantic idea by calling it a conton?</p>
<p>I'm glad I don't have to commute on a turnpike. Over time, such a journey would really take its toll on me.</p>

<p>If one wants to get a job as a professor of computer science, it helps to do a lot of networking in grad school.</p>
