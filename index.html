<p>Hello! I am a Stanford undergradute in the Class of 2015, majoring in mathematics with a minor in computer science. I'm interested in abstract algebra, possibly including algebraic topology or algebraic geometry.</p>
<p>
I tend to be interested in seeing connections between different ideas: I find math so fascinating partly because different subfields and concepts are very interconnected, reinforcing and influencing each other. Connections also influence other parts of my life: wordplay can be thought of as connections between words and phrases, for just one example.
<br>
<i>&ldquo;Good mathematicians see analogies between theorems or theories; the very best ones see analogies between analogies.&rdquo; &ndash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Banach">Stefan Banach</a>

<h2>Research and Projects</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p><b>AT&T Foundry</b>, Summer 2014: In this internship, I applied techniques from abstract algebra and statistics to problems within network theory, including understanding conditions on a network for a linear code to exist and implementing probabilistic power conservation techniques within sensor networks.
	  </p></li>
	<li><p><b>Sleep Data Tracker</b>, Summer 2014. In order to better understand my sleep schedule (to the degree that &ldquo;sleep schedule&rdquo; isn't an oxymoron), I wrote a script to track my sleep habits and collate statistics on them. The statistics side was written in Haskell, and the data plotting in Python (using <a href='http://matplotlib.org/'>Matplotlib</a> for the plotting). The results are automatically written up; <a href='Haskell/sleep/pretty_printed_sleep_data.pdf'>here</a> is my data from over the summer. At some point, I intend to clean this program up to the point where other people can use it.
	  </p></li>
	<li><p><b><a href='http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2013/DebrayWu-AstronomicalImplicationsofMachineLearning.pdf'>Astronomical Implications of Machine Learning</a></b>, Fall 2013: Working with Raymond Wu, we used supervised learning to develop a classifier for stellar lightcurves to detect whether they indicated the presence of exosolar planets. We achieved 82% classification accuracy. This project was for Stanford's <a href='http://cs229.stanford.edu/'>CS 229</a> (machine learning) class.<!-- I need to expand this definition -->
	  </p></li>
	<li><p><b><a href='CURIS/annotations.pdf'>Quick Error Detection in LLVM</a></b>, Summer 2013: I worked in a team, under direction of David Lin and Sundaram Anthanarayanan, to implement and improve <a href='http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699215'>Quick Error Detection</a>, a technique to insert error-checking routines for hardware errors into software with the <a href='http://llvm.org/'>LLVM compiler infrastructure</a>. This project was for Stanford's <a href='https://curis.stanford.edu/'>Computer Science Undergraduate Research Internship (CURIS)</a> research program.
	  </p></li>
	<li><p><b>A Cool Compiler</b>, Spring 2013: Working with Adam Perlman, we wrote a compiler for the <a href='http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/software/cool/cool-manual.pdf'>Cool programming language</a> to MIPS assembly. The compiler included a lexer, parser, semantic analyzer, and code generator. This project was for Stanford's CS 143 class.
	  </p></li>
	<li><p><b>Class Numbers of Binary Quadratic Forms</b>, Summer 2012: As part of this program, I did research on class numbers of binary quadratic forms, investigating their maxima and the structure of the class groups. The program included weekly presentations and writing a concluding paper. This project was part of the Stanford Research Institute in Mathematics (SURIM).

<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>I enjoy writing, but haven't found much time to put into it outside of class. Nonetheless, here is an incomplete list of things I have written or helped write.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="writing/IHUM_10B_essay.pdf">Surprising Manifestations of Incompleteness</a>: An essay I wrote in Spring 2012 for a class on the philosophy of science about incompleteness as a commonality across the formal sciences. This essay won a <a href="https://undergrad.stanford.edu/programs/thinking-matters/explore/boothe-prize">Boothe prize</a> for excellence in first-year writing at Stanford.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://stanfordflipside.com/2012/11/coursera-to-offer-social-dance/">Coursera to Offer Social Dance</a>, written with <a href="../~robinjia">Robin Jia</a> for <a href="http://stanfordflipside.com/">The Stanford Flipside</a>, a weekly humor newspaper.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I participated in <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/">National Novel Writing Month</a> 2010, and wrote 50,421 words towards a story called <i>I, Steven L. Robertson, do solemnly swear&hellip;</i></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Free Time</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>I've played bassoon for about half my life. Currently, I'm in the <a href="http://sso.stanford.edu/">Stanford Symphony Orchestra</a>, and occasionally other ensembles.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I love the outdoors, and will gladly spend a weekend hiking or backpacking.</p>
</li>

<li><p>This sentence has <span onclick="cornify_add();return false;" title="click me!">
thirty-two letters.
