<p>Hello! I am a <span id="grad_year">first</span>-year Ph.D. student in <a href='http://www.ma.utexas.edu/'>UT
Austin's department of mathematics</a>. I'm interested in algebraic topology and related fields, including
algebraic geometry and representation theory. Pre&shy;viously, I was at Stanford University as an undergraduate; I
graduated with a math major and CS minor in June 2015.</p>

<p> I find mathematics so fascinating partly because different subfields and
concepts are very inter&shy;connected, reinforcing and influencing each other.
<br> <i>&ldquo;Good mathematicians see analogies between theorems or theories; the very best ones see analogies
between analogies.&rdquo; &ndash; <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Banach">Stefan Banach</a>

<h2>Research and Projects</h2>
<p>
These projects are a mix of math and computer science, and include a few side projects. A few of these will migrate
to <a href='https://github.com/adebray'>my GitHub</a> soon.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><b><a href='//dropbox.github.io/dropbox-api-v2-explorer/'>Dropbox API Explorer</a></b>, Summer 2015: my
	summer internship project at Dropbox. The API Explorer is a tool to learn the Dropbox v2 API and quickly test
	examples, and is generated from the API spec. The project uses <a href='//facebook.github.io/react/'>React</a>
	and was written in <a href='http://www.typescriptlang.org/'>TypeScript</a>. See also the associated <a
	href='//blogs.dropbox.com/developers/2015/08/announcing-the-dropbox-api-v2-explorer/'>blog post</a>.</p></li>
	<li><p><b><a href='writing/adebray_senior_thesis.pdf'>Modular Representation Theory and the CDE
	Triangle</a></b>, 2014-15: my senior thesis, written under the direction of Akshay Venkatesh as part of the
	honors major in mathematics. I discussed modular representation theory and a collection of results on modular
	representations encapsulated in a diagram called the CDE triangle, presenting the background theory of modular
	representations needed to state and prove these results and using these results in several explicit
	examples.</p></li>
	<li><p><b>AT&amp;T Foundry</b>, Summer 2014: In this internship, I applied techniques from abstract algebra and
	statistics to problems within network theory, including understanding conditions on a network for a linear code
	to exist and implementing probabilistic power conservation techniques within sensor networks. </p></li>
	<li><p><b>Sleep Data Tracker</b>, Summer 2014. In order to better understand my sleep schedule (to the degree
	that &ldquo;sleep schedule&rdquo; isn't an oxymoron), I wrote a script to track my sleep habits and collate
	statistics on them. The statistics side was written in Haskell, and the data plotting in Python (using <a
	href='//matplotlib.org/'>Matplotlib</a> for the plotting). The results are automatically written up; <a
	href='Haskell/sleep/pretty_printed_sleep_data.pdf'>here</a> is my data from over the summer. At some point, I
	intend to clean this program up to the point where other people can use it. </p></li>
	<li><p><b><a
	href='http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2013/DebrayWu-AstronomicalImplicationsofMachineLearning.pdf'>Astronomical
	Implications of Machine Learning</a></b>, Fall 2013: Working with Raymond Wu, we used supervised learning to
	develop a classifier for stellar lightcurves to detect whether they indicated the presence of exosolar planets.
	We achieved 82% classification accuracy. This project was for Stanford's <a href='//cs229.stanford.edu/'>CS
	229</a> (machine learning) class.<!-- I need to expand this definition --> </p></li>
	<li><p><b><a href='CURIS/annotations.pdf'>Quick Error Detection in LLVM</a></b>, Summer 2013: I worked in a
	team, under direction of David Lin and Sundaram Anthanarayanan, to implement and improve <a
	href='//ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5699215'>Quick Error Detection</a>, a technique to
	insert error-checking routines for hardware errors into software with the <a href='//llvm.org/'>LLVM compiler
	infrastructure</a>. This project was for Stanford's <a href='//curis.stanford.edu/'>Computer Science
	Undergraduate Research Internship (CURIS)</a> research program. </p></li>
	<!--<li><p><b>A Cool Compiler</b>, Spring 2013: Working with Adam Perlman, we wrote a compiler for the <a
	href='//theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/software/cool/cool-manual.pdf'>Cool programming language</a> to MIPS
	assembly. The compiler included a lexer, parser, semantic analyzer, and code generator. This project was for
	Stanford's CS 143 class. </p></li>-->
	<li><p><b>Class Numbers of Binary Quadratic Forms</b>, Summer 2012: As part of this program, I did research on
	class numbers of binary quadratic forms, investigating their maxima and the structure of the class groups. The
	program included weekly presentations and writing a concluding paper. This project was part of the Stanford
	Research Institute in Mathematics (SURIM). </p></li>
