And now it's time for Silly Songs with Arun, the part of the show where Arun comes out and sings a silly song.

<h2> The Peano Man </h2>
<h4> Inspired by <i>The Piano Man</i>, by Billy Joel<br>
January 20, 2013</h4>
It's 4:00 on a Saturday.<br>
The normal group shuffles in.<br>
A man sitting next to me tells me<br>
That his thesis is awfully thin.<br>
<br>
He says, "Son, can you prove me a theorem<br>
I'm not really sure how it goes<br>
But it's sad and it's sweet and G&ouml;del-incomplete,<br>
And it'd help me to find some zeroes."<br>
<br>
La la la d/d(da).<br>
La la d/d(da) da dum...<br>
<br>
Chorus: Write us a proof, you're the Peano Man,<br>
Write us a proof tonight.<br>
Well, we're all in the mood for an axiom,<br>
And you make the logic all right...<br>
<br>
Now John in <b>Q</b>-bar is a friend of mine.<br>
He proves things in ZFC.<br>
And he's quick with a claim or to look up a name,<br>
But there's someplace that he'd rather be<br>
He says, "Joe, I believe I'm a corollary."<br>
As the smile ran away from his face.<br>
"Well I'm sure that I could be a physicist,<br>
If I could get out of this place."<br>
<br>
La la la d/d(da).<br>
La la d/d(da) da dum...<br>
<br>
Now Paul is a real function analyst,<br>
Who approaches his work with a knife,<br>
And he's talking with Davy, who's computin' sin(<i>a</i><i>b</i>)<br>
And probably will be for life.<br>
<br>
And the undergrads all practice algebra,<br>
All proving what was to be shown,<br>
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call problem sets,<br>
But it's better than thinkin' alone.<br>
<br>
Chorus<br>
<br>
It's a pretty good group for a Saturday,<br>
And the professor gives me a smile.<br>
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see<br>
To forget about math for a while.<br>
And the blackboard, it looks like a snowstorm,<br>
As lemmas and claims become clear,<br>
And they sit at their desks and look over their tests,<br>
And say, "man, what are you doin' here?"<br>
<br>
La la la d/d(da).<br>
La la d/d(da) da dum...<br>
<br>
Chorus
