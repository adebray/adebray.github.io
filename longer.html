<h1>Longer-Form Humor</h1>
</div>
<p>Along with my <a href="puns.html">page of puns</a>, I've occasionally written slightly longer-form humor.</p>
<h2>The Bike Brigade</h2>
<p>(with apologies to Lord Tennyson)<br /></p>
<p>Half a mile, half a mile,<br />
half a mile onward.<br />
All in the Circle of Death<br />
Rode the six hundred.<br />
&ldquo;Forward, the Bike Brigade!<br />
On time to class!&rdquo; he said:<br />
Into the Circle of Death<br />
Rode the six hundred.<br /></p>
<p>&ldquo;Forward, the Bike Brigade!&rdquo;<br />
Was there a kid afraid?<br />
Not tho&rsquo; the student knew<br />
Someone had blunder'd:<br />
Theirs not to wait their turn,<br />
Theirs not to reason learn,<br />
Theirs but to crash and burn:<br />
Into the Circle of Death<br />
Rode the six hundred.<br /></p>
<p>Bikers to right of them,<br />
Tourists to left of them,<br />
Golf carts in front of them<br />
Hurried and wonder'd;<br />
Storm'd at with horn and yell,<br />
Boldly they rode (not well),<br />
Into the roundabout,<br />
Into a great farewell<br />
Rode the six hundred.<br /></p>
<p>Flash'd all their signals bare,<br />
Flash'd as they turned in err,<br />
Scaring some students there,<br />
Hurrying to class, while<br />
All Stanford wonder'd:<br />
Plunged in the roundabout<br />
Crashed going wrong ways out;<br />
Tourist and student<br />
Reel'd from the total rout<br />
Shatter'd and sunder'd.<br />
Then they rode back, but not<br />
Not the six hundred.<br /></p>
<p>Bikers to right of them,<br />
Tourists to left of them,<br />
Golf carts behind them<br />
Hurried and wonder'd;<br />
Storm'd at with horn and yell,<br />
While friends and freshmen fell<br />
They that had biked so well<br />
Came thro&rsquo; the roundabout,<br />
Back from a sure farewell,<br />
All that was left of them,<br />
Left of six hundred.<br /></p>
<p>When can their skid marks fade?<br />
O the wild ride they made!<br />
All Stanford wondered.<br />
Honour the ride they made,<br />
Honour the Bike Brigade,<br />
Noble six hundred.<br /></p>
<h2>&ldquo;Students Campaign to Bring Twerking to Viennese Ball&rdquo;</h2>
<p>An article I wrote for the Stanford Flipside, but they ended up not using.</p>
<p>Stanford's Viennese Ball has long been known for its elegance and classiness, but a group of attendees are requesting that this year, the organizers bring twerking to the event, as part of an attempt to modernize the festivities.</p>
<p>Many dancers are embracing this movement, including Richard Powers, the renowned social dance instructor. &ldquo;At first, I wasn't sure how seriously to take these students,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but they've really shown their twerk, and now I understand the thrust of their argument. Dance evolves in fascinating ways, shaking up old ideas, and twerking is no exception. If there's enough student interest, I can open a section of Dance 162, Living Traditions of Twerking, next fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The basic step is quite easy, actually,&rdquo; he demonstrated. &ldquo;Now, fake what you thought you saw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Flipside also reached out to a representative of the Viennese Ball planning committee, Ike Summergreen. He remarked, &ldquo;I'm not really sure what to think of it&hellip; I'm not a big fan of twerking, but if it gets more people to turn up at Viennese Ball, then that's good, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for the Flipside, we're all for this hip dance trend. Twerkers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your shame!</p>
<h2>&ldquo;I'm Dreaming of a Black Friday&rdquo;</h2>
<p>(with apolgies to whoever wrote White Christmas)</p>
<p>I'm dreaming of a Black Friday&hellip;<br />
just like the ones I used to know,<br />
Where the best deals glisten,<br />
And children listen,<br />
To hear shoppers in a row&hellip;<br /></p>
<p>I'm dreaming of a Black Friday,<br />
with every dollar that I save,<br />
May you get a deal on that microwave,<br />
And may all your retailers be brave.<br /></p>
<p>I'm dreaming of a Black Friday,<br />
To put our corporations in the green,<br />
With consumers spending,<br />
and bankers lending,<br />
so that we live beyond our means&hellip;<br /></p>
<p>I'm dreaming of a Black Friday,<br />
with every cashier that's attacked,<br />
May your sales be plentiful and stacked,<br />
And may all your Fridays,<br />
all your Fridays,<br />
all your Fridays be black.</p>
<h2><i>Lies, Damned Lies, and Statistics</i></h2>
<p>This preview has been approved for all audiences by the Motion Picture Association of America.</p>
<p>"My name's Kurt Osis. I'm twenty-six years old, and I, uh, teach statistics at a high school in Northern Virginia.</p>
<p>No, that excuse doesn't work anymore. Let me try again.</p>
<p>My name is Kurt Osis. I am twenty-six years old, and I am a data scientist for the CIA. It is my job to discover trends and anomalies in the petabytes of data that the CIA collects about the world each week. We've saved lives by finding patterns in the data that nobody else could.</p>
<p>So anyways, a few months ago, we really started to put the 'applied&rsquo; in applied statistics."</p>
<p>&lt;ominous music, cut&gt;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Osis, we have a &ndash; mission for you. You see, desperate times make for desperate measures, and if the kernel falls to the Bayesians&rsquo; plot&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lt;cut, screeching brakes&gt;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you didn't expect it, but&hellip; you're about to be an outlier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lt;gunshot, cut&gt;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been assigned Agent MLE as your partner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, I'm Emily! Like you, I used to be approximately normal. I did swimsuit modeling. Now, I do statistical modeling&hellip; let's go put the discreet back into discrete math.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lt;cut, explosion, chopper noises&gt;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about sQ's jackknife!?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be no use to you &ndash; your foolish model failed to predict me. You Americans never learn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lt;cut, music swells&gt;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think &ndash; did we just, um, share a moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lt;cut&gt;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don't tell me where the kernel is in the next thirty seconds, you're going to end up uniformly distributed across all of London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lt;cut, B-BOOM!&gt;</p>
<p>Coming Summer 2015: Lies, Damned Lies, and Statistics.</p>
<p>&lt;fade to black&gt;</p>
<h2>The Peano Man</h2>
<p>(with apologies to Billy Joel)</p>
<p>It's 4:00 on a Saturday.<br>
The normal group shuffles in.<br>
A man sitting next to me tells me<br>
That his thesis is awfully thin.</p>
<p>He says, &ldquo;Son, can you prove me a theorem<br>
I'm not really sure how it goes<br>
But it's sad and it's sweet and GÃ¶del-incomplete,<br>
And it'd help me to find some zeroes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>La la la d/d(da).<br>
La la d/d(da) da dum&hellip;</p>
<p>Write us a proof, you're the Peano Man,<br>
Write us a proof tonight.<br>
Well, we're all in the mood for an axiom,<br>
And you make the logic all right&hellip;</p>
<p>Now John in <b>Q</b>-bar is a friend of mine.<br>
He proves things in ZFC.<br>
And he's quick with a claim or to look up a name,<br>
But there's someplace that he'd rather be<br>
He says, &ldquo;Joe, I believe I'm a corollary.&rdquo;<br>
As the smile ran away from his face.<br>
&ldquo;Well I'm sure that I could be a physicist,<br>
If I could get out of this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>La la la d/d(da).<br>
La la d/d(da) da dum&hellip;</p>
<p>Now Paul is a real function analyst,<br>
Who approaches his work with a knife,<br>
And he's talking with Davy, who's computin&rsquo; sin(a*b)<br>
And probably will be for life.</p>
<p>And the undergrads all practice algebra,<br>
All proving what was to be shown,<br>
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call problem sets,<br>
But it's better than thinkin&rsquo; alone.</p>
<p>Write us a proof, you're the Peano Man,<br>
Write us a proof tonight.<br>
Well, we're all in the mood for an axiom,<br>
And you make the logic all right&hellip;</p>
<p>It's a pretty good group for a Saturday,<br>
And the professor gives me a smile.<br>
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see<br>
To forget about math for a while.<br>
And the blackboard, it looks like a snowstorm,<br>
As lemmas and claims become clear,<br>
And they sit at their desks and look over their tests,<br>
And say, &ldquo;man, what are you doin&rsquo; here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>La la la d/d(da).<br>
La la d/d(da) da dum&hellip;</p>
<p>Write us a proof, you're the Peano Man,<br>
Write us a proof tonight.<br>
Well, we're all in the mood for an axiom,<br>
And you make the logic all right&hellip;</p>
