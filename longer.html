<h2><a href='#calculate'>Shut up and calculate</a></h2>
<p>(with apologies to David Mermin and Walk the Moon)</p>

<p>
“Now can you prove this fact,<br>
And don’t reformulate,”<br>
I tried a general tack<br>
She said, “shut up and calculate!”<br>
This problem is no heavyweight,<br>
She said “oo-oo-ooh, shut up and calculate!”</p>

<p>
I was victim to nLab:<br>
Categorical, physical gift of gab,<br>
Everyday I had fifteen open tabs.<br>
Oh, I was bound to get abstracter,<br>
Bound to get abstracter&hellip;</p>

<p>
I dropped the chalk,<br>
I don’t know how to solve it.<br>
She took the board and she said,</p>

<p>
“Just check this row’s exact,<br>
No need to ruminate,”<br>
I looked to things abstract,<br>
She said “shut up and calculate!”<br>
This problem helps me graduate,<br>
She said “oo-oo-ooh, shut up and calculate!”</p>

<p>
Coherent sheaves on a certain scheme.<br>
My kind of mad, undergrad, research dream,<br>
With fancy new techniques held in high esteem.<br>
Working in the bounded derived cate&ndash;<br>
Bounded derived category&hellip;</p>

<p>
She looked alarmed;<br>
Looks like that’s not how math goes,<br>
She wanted me to instead,</p>

<p>
“Just mount a straight attack,<br>
Why must you bloviate?”<br>
I felt my technique lacks,<br>
She said “shut up and calculate!”<br>
I know I overcomplicate,<br>
She said “oo-oo-ooh, shut up and calculate!”</p>

<p>
(Oh c’mon nerd!)</p>

<p>
She took me on,<br>
As her doctoral student.<br>
Before I’m gone,<br>
I better think straight!<br>
Each time we met,<br>
No traction from abstraction,<br>
She rolled her eyes and she said,</p>

<p>
“Why don’t you take a crack,<br>
Don’t just pontificate,”<br>
I asked if I’m on track,<br>
She said, “shut up and calculate!”<br>
No need to hyperventilate,<br>
She said “oo-oo-ooh, shut up and calc&ndash;”</p>

<p>
“Don’t get so sidetracked<br>
Or make your proof ornate,”<br>
I tried on Artin stacks,<br>
She said, “shut up and calculate!”<br>
There’s more to do than meditate,<br>
She said “oo-oo-ooh, shut up and calculate!”</p>

<p>
“Oo-oo-ooh, shut up and calculate!”<br>

<h2><a href='#leray'>That's a Leray!</a></h2>
<p>(with apologies to Jean Leray and Dean Martin)<br></p>

<p>
When you have <i>E</i> → <i>B</i> and want homology, that’s a Leray,<br>
When your fibers are cute and you want to compute, that’s a Leray.<br>
For <i>E</i><sub>2</sub> what you have to do is compute <i>H</i><sup><i>q</i></sup>,<br>
Of <i>F</i>, u-sing some priors,<br>
Then you chase <i>H</i><sup><i>p</i></sup> of the base to the total space<br>
In the case you desire.
</p>

<p>
When you want to transgress and have more than a guess, that's a Leray,<br>
When the <i>E</i><sub>2</sub> page shines with nice vanishing lines you're in luck.<br>
When you’re working with schemes but you know you’re not scheming, then I’d say,<br>
<i>Scusa mi</i>, but you see, back in topology that’s a Leray!
</p>

<p>
When&hellip;<br>
You&hellip;<br>
Pushforward sheaves down to orbits or leaves, that’s a Leray (that’s a Leray),<br>
And when you and a friend need to know <i>K</i>(<i>G</i>, <i>n</i>), that's a Leray (that’s a Leray).<br>
Or converse, run it in reverse (don’t be so adverse),<br>
Like Serre’s terse calculations (calcula-calculations),<br>
<i>H</i>*(<i>E</i>) sometimes helps you see how to get at <i>B</i><br>
With some key applications. (To fibrations!)
</p>

<p>
When you really can flex on that double complex, that’s a Leray (that’s a Leray),<br>
When the map on the edge can be given by wedge, you’re in luck,<br>
When you’re working with schemes but you know you’re not scheming, then I’d say,<br>
<i>Scusa mi</i>, but you see, back in topology that’s a Leray! (a Leray, that’s a Leray!)

I was checking in my luggage, but I brought too much.<br>

Though my mind could think I don't need my passport,<br>
I hear the voices at the counter,<br>
I can hear them say,

Masquerading as a frequent flyer,<br>
Will not get your quota any higher,<br>
And if you claim to be a pilot,<br>
It surely means that you won't go.<br>
In another line that's moving so slowly,<br>
TSA makes us do things unholy,<br>
I put my baggage on the scanner,<br>

<h2><a href="#vball">&ldquo;Students Campaign to Bring Twerking to Viennese Ball&rdquo;</a></h2>
<p>An article I wrote for the Stanford Flipside, but they ended up not using.</p>
<p>Stanford's Viennese Ball has long been known for its elegance and classiness, but a group of attendees are requesting that this year, the organizers bring twerking to the event, as part of an attempt to modernize the festivities.</p>
<p>Many dancers are embracing this movement, including Richard Powers, the renowned social dance instructor. &ldquo;At first, I wasn't sure how seriously to take these students,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but they've really shown their twerk, and now I understand the thrust of their argument. Dance evolves in fascinating ways, shaking up old ideas, and twerking is no exception. If there's enough student interest, I can open a section of Dance 162, Living Traditions of Twerking, next fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The basic step is quite easy, actually,&rdquo; he demonstrated. &ldquo;Now, fake what you thought you saw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Flipside also reached out to a representative of the Viennese Ball planning committee, Ike Summergreen. He remarked, &ldquo;I'm not really sure what to think of it&hellip; I'm not a big fan of twerking, but if it gets more people to turn up at Viennese Ball, then that's good, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for the Flipside, we're all for this hip dance trend. Twerkers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your shame!</p>

That his thesis is awfully thin.</p>

To forget about math for a while.<br>
And the blackboard, it looks like a snowstorm,<br>
