<h2><a href='#hodge'>Hodge star</a></h2>
<p>(with apologies to Simon Donaldson and Smash Mouth)</p>

<p>
Somebody once told me<br>
That up to homotopy,<br>
The intersection form knows <i>M</i><sup>4</sup><br>
When pos def I was surprised<br>
It can be diagonalized<br>
And the proof uses physics and mo-ore:<br>
Well, Yang-Mills starts running and it don’t stop running<br>
Take a nice twist if you’ve got enough cunning<br>
Didn’t make sense to path-integrate,<br>
But still there’s ways we can calculate.<br>
Use SU(2), use SO(3),<br>
And what’s wrong with constants all called <i>C</i><br>
You’ll never know if you don’t go,<br>
You’re never fixed if you don’t flow&hellip;</p>

<p>
Chorus:<br>
Hey now, you’re the Hodge star, get your form on, go play,<br>
Hey now, Yang-Mills 2-forms, take that space but, mod gauge<br>
All Hodge-fixed things are gone,<br>
Anti-self-dual forms are instanto-ons&hellip;</p>

<p>
It’s a cool space, and looks good to first order<br>
If you think it’s smooth go look at the border<br>
Simon Donaldson, he begs to differ<br>
Judging by the cusps in his thesis's picture<br>
So smooth it out, it’s not too hard to mend<br>
The intersection form is the same on both ends.<br>
And what you get: his proof’s scored<br>
That’s the way some <b>CP</b><sup>2</sup>s and <i>M</i><sup>4</sup> co-bord</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>
Hey now, you’re the Hodge star, get your form on, go play,<br>
Hey now, you’re an all-star, get your Fields on, get paid,<br>
All Hodge-fixed things are gone,<br>
Anti-self-dual fo-orms&hellip;</p>

<p>
Somebody once asked<br>
Why’s this theory such a task<br>
I hope things simplify at low energies,<br>
I said yep, what a concept,<br>
Seiberg-Witten theory does all that<br>
So let us all use a Coulomb gaaaaaaauge<br>
Well, Yang-Mills starts running and it don’t stop running,<br>
Low energy means there’s something else coming<br>
Didn’t expect these new EOMs<br>
The branes are hard and the math is dense<br>
Use SU(2) gauge symmetry,<br>
Broken down to a U(1) theory<br>
You’ll learn a remarkable fact (fact!)<br>
Your moduli space is compact!</p>

<p>
Hey now, you’re the Hodge star, get your form on, go play,<br>
Hey now, there’s Dirac stars, new equations get made,<br>
Whose zeros make manifo-olds,<br>
Giving faster proofs than tools of o-old.<br>
And all that glitters is go-old,<br>
When topology meets monopo-oles.</p>

<p>(to the tune of "Paper rings" by Taylor Swift)</p>

<p>
The moon is high<br>
Like the scale of the crazy energy<br>
We’d need to measure superstringy symmetry<br>
Far beyond the limits of the LHC</p>

<p>
The wine is cold<br>
Like the relic remnants of the CMB<br>
Big Bang says that we need a new theory<br>
Now we're searching for that quantum gravity</p>

<p>
(Hey!)<br>
Try one loop, 'cause you know you’ll gain some insight,<br>
(Oh!)<br>
Try two loops, just to make sure the proof’s right,<br>
(Oh!)<br>
Three loops! It’ll take you the whole night<br>
(One, two, one two three four!)</p>

<p>
I like 4d things, but I'd quantize you with superstrings,<br>
Uh-huh, that's right, darling,<br>
You’re the one I want, and<br>
I hate experiments, except when we finally can test this,<br>
Uh-huh, it's right, darling,<br>
You’re the one I want<br>
In superstrings,<br>
In reference frames,<br>

Oh-ohh, you’re the one I want</p>

<p>
In the landscape, an effective sugra view,<br>
where the gauge group's SO(32),<br>
I'm with you! 'Cause I know the vacuum's true</p>

<p>
Which takes me back<br>
To the papers that we cited of S.N. Bose,<br>
Honey, without all the fluxes, fields, and flows<br>
We wouldn't have theories to propose</p>

<p>
So, (hey!)<br>
Try one loop, just to see what all the terms are,<br>
(Oh!)<br>
Try two loops, push the theory out real far,<br>
(Oh!)<br>
Three loops! Keeping track of those h-bars<br>
(One, two, one two three four!)</p>

<p>
I like 4d things, but I'd quantize you with superstrings,<br>
Uh-huh! That's right! Darling,<br>
You're the one I want, and<br>
I hate experiments, except when we finally can test this,<br>
Uh-huh! It's right! Darling,<br>
You're the one I want<br>
In superstrings,<br>
In D<i>p</i>-branes,<br>
In CY3s,<br>
Oh-ohh, you're the one I want</p>

I want your GUT breakthrough<br>
I want your computations too<br>
I want your 2d worldsheets<br>
Wrap your branes around me, baby boy!</p>

I want your Type I and Type II<br>

I want your T-dual theories<br>
Wrap your branes around me, baby boy!</p>

Uh-huh, that’s right,<br>

I hate divergences except when they clean up nice like this,<br>

Uh-huh! It's right! Darling,<br>
You're the one I want<br>

<h2><a href='#prime'>For the longest prime</a></h2>
<p>(with apologies to Billy Joel)</p>

<p>
Whoa-oh-ah-oh, for the longest prime,<br>
Whoa-ah-oh, for the longest—
</p>
<p>
If you heard the primes were just finite,<br>
You could prove yourself that that's not right,<br>
All of your primes, see,<br>
Can't factor 1 + prod <i>p</i>,<br>
And QED, there is no longest prime.
</p>
<p>
Though that theorem's proof is set in stone,<br>
Still we ask what prime's the largest known.<br>
If you're invested,<br>
Find one, and until it's bested<br>
It holds the title of the longest prime.
</p>
<p>
Whoa-oh-ah-oh, for the longest prime,<br>
Whoa-ah-oh, for the longest—
</p>
<p>
One big family's due to M. Mersenne,<br>
Working just with paper and with pen,<br>
He made conjectures,<br>
Gave influential lectures,<br>
Shaped how we're searching for the longest primes.
</p>
<p>
2 to some large prime minus 1,<br>
Though not always prime,<br>
It's been quite a run.<br>
Lucas-Lehmer tells us so fast,<br>
For primes that are vast<br>
And it's more than we hoped for
</p>
<p>
Mersenne primes give perfect numbers too:<br>
Given <i>p</i> take <i>p</i> + 1 choose 2,<br>
If you want spoilers,<br>
Read the proofs of Euclid-Euler<br>
For applications of the longest primes.
</p>
<p>
We think that the converse is true,<br>
The proof isn't known;<br>
There's much left to do.<br>
Do all perfect numbers come like this?<br>
We only have a list<br>
And it's more than we hoped for
</p>
<p>
The Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search,<br>
Lately's brought forth quite a research surge,<br>
Seems like the future's<br>
A bunch of home computers,<br>
Who are searching jointly for the longest prime.
</p>
<p>
Whoa-oh-ah-oh, for the longest prime,<br>
Whoa-ah-oh, for the longest prime<br>
Whoa-ah-oh, for the longest prime&hellip;

I tried a general tack<br>
She said, “shut up and calculate!”<br>
This problem is no heavyweight,<br>
She said “oo-oo-ooh, shut up and calculate!”</p>

Categorical, physical gift of gab,<br>
Everyday I had fifteen open tabs.<br>
Oh, I was bound to get abstracter,<br>

I dropped the chalk,<br>
I don’t know how to solve it.<br>
She took the board and she said,</p>

<p>
“Just check this row’s exact,<br>
No need to ruminate,”<br>
I looked to things abstract,<br>
She said “shut up and calculate!”<br>
This problem helps me graduate,<br>
She said “oo-oo-ooh, shut up and calculate!”</p>

<p>
Coherent sheaves on a certain scheme.<br>
My kind of mad, undergrad, research dream,<br>
With fancy new techniques held in high esteem.<br>
Working in the bounded derived cate&ndash;<br>
Bounded derived category&hellip;</p>

<p>
She looked alarmed;<br>
Looks like that’s not how math goes,<br>

(Oh c’mon nerd!)</p>

<p>
She took me on,<br>
As her doctoral student.<br>
Before I’m gone,<br>
I better think straight!<br>
Each time we met,<br>
No traction from abstraction,<br>
She rolled her eyes and she said,</p>

<p>
“Why don’t you take a crack,<br>
Don’t just pontificate,”<br>
I asked if I’m on track,<br>
She said, “shut up and calculate!”<br>
No need to hyperventilate,<br>

“Don’t get so sidetracked<br>
Or make your proof ornate,”<br>
I tried on Artin stacks,<br>

<h2><a href='#leray'>That's a Leray!</a></h2>
<p>(with apologies to Jean Leray and Dean Martin)<br></p>

<p>
When you have <i>E</i> → <i>B</i> and want homology, that’s a Leray,<br>
When your fibers are cute and you want to compute, that’s a Leray.<br>
For <i>E</i><sub>2</sub> what you have to do is compute <i>H</i><sup><i>q</i></sup>,<br>
Of <i>F</i>, u-sing some priors,<br>
Then you chase <i>H</i><sup><i>p</i></sup> of the base to the total space<br>
In the case you desire.
</p>

<p>
When you want to transgress and have more than a guess, that's a Leray,<br>
When the <i>E</i><sub>2</sub> page shines with nice vanishing lines you're in luck.<br>
When you’re working with schemes but you know you’re not scheming, then I’d say,<br>
<i>Scusa mi</i>, but you see, back in topology that’s a Leray!
</p>

<p>
When&hellip;<br>
You&hellip;<br>
Pushforward sheaves down to orbits or leaves, that’s a Leray (that’s a Leray),<br>
And when you and a friend need to know <i>K</i>(<i>G</i>, <i>n</i>), that's a Leray (that’s a Leray).<br>
Or converse, run it in reverse (don’t be so adverse),<br>
Like Serre’s terse calculations (calcula-calculations),<br>
<i>H</i>*(<i>E</i>) sometimes helps you see how to get at <i>B</i><br>
With some key applications. (To fibrations!)
</p>

<p>
When you really can flex on that double complex, that’s a Leray (that’s a Leray),<br>
When the map on the edge can be given by wedge, you’re in luck,<br>
When you’re working with schemes but you know you’re not scheming, then I’d say,<br>
<i>Scusa mi</i>, but you see, back in topology that’s a Leray! (a Leray, that’s a Leray!)

for Heisenberg spin chains.<br>
And the renormalizin'<br>

I would need no calculators,<br>
To write down correlators<br>
On spacelike hyperplanes.<br>

I could be another Feynman<br>

Oh I&hellip; could tell you why,<br>
the gauge group's not U(4),<br>
I could know what happens at a black hole's core.<br>
And what the Higgs<br>
is really for&hellip;

I'd exactly solve the Isin',<br>
As easily as sneezin',<br>
On any nice domain.<br>
With quantized gravitation<br>
I could be a big sensation<br>
If I only had a brane.&rdquo;

<h2><a href='#bike_brigade'>The Bike Brigade</a></h2>
<p>(with apologies to Lord Tennyson)<br /></p>
<p>Half a mile, half a mile,<br />
half a mile onward.<br />
All in the Circle of Death<br />
Rode the six hundred.<br />
&ldquo;Forward, the Bike Brigade!<br />
On time to class!&rdquo; he said:<br />
Into the Circle of Death<br />
Rode the six hundred.<br /></p>
<p>&ldquo;Forward, the Bike Brigade!&rdquo;<br />
Was there a kid afraid?<br />
Not tho' the student knew<br />
Someone had blunder'd:<br />
Theirs not to wait their turn,<br />
Theirs not to reason learn,<br />
Theirs but to crash and burn:<br />
Into the Circle of Death<br />
Rode the six hundred.<br /></p>
<p>Bikers to right of them,<br />
Tourists to left of them,<br />
Golf carts in front of them<br />
Hurried and wonder'd;<br />
Storm'd at with horn and yell,<br />
Boldly they rode (not well),<br />
Into the roundabout,<br />
Into a great farewell<br />
Rode the six hundred.<br /></p>
<p>Flash'd all their signals bare,<br />
Flash'd as they turned in err,<br />
Scaring some students there,<br />
Hurrying to class, while<br />
All Stanford wonder'd:<br />
Plunged in the roundabout<br />
Crashed going wrong ways out;<br />
Tourist and student<br />
Reel'd from the total rout<br />
Shatter'd and sunder'd.<br />
Then they rode back, but not<br />
Not the six hundred.<br /></p>
<p>Bikers to right of them,<br />
Tourists to left of them,<br />
Golf carts behind them<br />
Hurried and wonder'd;<br />
Storm'd at with horn and yell,<br />
While friends and freshmen fell<br />
They that had biked so well<br />
Came thro' the roundabout,<br />
Back from a sure farewell,<br />
All that was left of them,<br />
Left of six hundred.<br /></p>
<p>When can their skid marks fade?<br />
O the wild ride they made!<br />
All Stanford wondered.<br />
Honour the ride they made,<br />
Honour the Bike Brigade,<br />
Noble six hundred.<br /></p>

<h2><a href="#vball">&ldquo;Students Campaign to Bring Twerking to Viennese Ball&rdquo;</a></h2>
<p>An article I wrote for the Stanford Flipside, but they ended up not using.</p>
<p>Stanford's Viennese Ball has long been known for its elegance and classiness, but a group of attendees are requesting that this year, the organizers bring twerking to the event, as part of an attempt to modernize the festivities.</p>
<p>Many dancers are embracing this movement, including Richard Powers, the renowned social dance instructor. &ldquo;At first, I wasn't sure how seriously to take these students,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but they've really shown their twerk, and now I understand the thrust of their argument. Dance evolves in fascinating ways, shaking up old ideas, and twerking is no exception. If there's enough student interest, I can open a section of Dance 162, Living Traditions of Twerking, next fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The basic step is quite easy, actually,&rdquo; he demonstrated. &ldquo;Now, fake what you thought you saw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Flipside also reached out to a representative of the Viennese Ball planning committee, Ike Summergreen. He remarked, &ldquo;I'm not really sure what to think of it&hellip; I'm not a big fan of twerking, but if it gets more people to turn up at Viennese Ball, then that's good, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for the Flipside, we're all for this hip dance trend. Twerkers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your shame!</p>

May you get a deal on that microwave,<br />
And may all your retailers be brave.<br /></p>

To put our corporations in the green,<br />
With consumers spending,<br />

May your sales be plentiful and stacked,<br />

<p>My name is Kurt Osis. I am twenty-six years old, and I am a data scientist for the CIA. It is my job to discover trends and anomalies in the petabytes of data that the CIA collects about the world each week. We've saved lives by finding patterns in the data that nobody else could.</p>

<h2><a href="#peano_man">The Peano Man</a></h2>
<p>(with apologies to Billy Joel)</p>
<p>It's 4:00 on a Saturday.<br>
The normal group shuffles in.<br>
A man sitting next to me tells me<br>
That his thesis is awfully thin.</p>
<p>He says, &ldquo;Son, can you prove me a theorem<br>
I'm not really sure how it goes<br>
But it's sad and it's sweet and Gödel-incomplete,<br>
And it'd help me to find some zeroes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>La la la d/d(da).<br>
La la d/d(da) da dum&hellip;</p>
<p>Write us a proof, you're the Peano Man,<br>
Write us a proof tonight.<br>
Well, we're all in the mood for an axiom,<br>
And you make the logic all right&hellip;</p>
<p>Now John in ℚ-bar is a friend of mine.<br>
He proves things in ZFC.<br>
And he's quick with a claim or to look up a name,<br>
But there's someplace that he'd rather be<br>
He says, &ldquo;Joe, I believe I'm a corollary.&rdquo;<br>
As the smile ran away from his face.<br>
&ldquo;Well I'm sure that I could be a physicist,<br>
If I could get out of this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>La la la d/d(da).<br>
La la d/d(da) da dum&hellip;</p>
<p>Now Paul is a real function analyst,<br>
Who approaches his work with a knife,<br>
And he's talking with Davy, who's computin' sin(<i>a</i>*<i>b</i>)<br>
And probably will be for life.</p>
<p>And the undergrads all practice algebra,<br>
All proving what was to be shown,<br>
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call problem sets,<br>
But it's better than thinkin' alone.</p>
<p>Write us a proof, you're the Peano Man,<br>
Write us a proof tonight.<br>
Well, we're all in the mood for an axiom,<br>
And you make the logic all right&hellip;</p>
<p>It's a pretty good group for a Saturday,<br>
And the professor gives me a smile.<br>
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see<br>
To forget about math for a while.<br>
And the blackboard, it looks like a snowstorm,<br>
As lemmas and claims become clear,<br>
And they sit at their desks and look over their tests,<br>
And say, &ldquo;man, what are you doin' here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>La la la d/d(da).<br>
