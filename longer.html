<h1>Longer-Form Humor</h1>
</div>
<p>Along with my <a href="puns.html">page of puns</a>, I've occasionally written slightly longer-form humor.</p>
<h2 id="bike_brigade"><a href='#bike_brigade'>The Bike Brigade</a></h2>
<p>(with apologies to Lord Tennyson)<br /></p>
<p>Half a mile, half a mile,<br />
half a mile onward.<br />
All in the Circle of Death<br />
Rode the six hundred.<br />
&ldquo;Forward, the Bike Brigade!<br />
On time to class!&rdquo; he said:<br />
Into the Circle of Death<br />
Rode the six hundred.<br /></p>
<p>&ldquo;Forward, the Bike Brigade!&rdquo;<br />
Was there a kid afraid?<br />
Not tho' the student knew<br />
Someone had blunder'd:<br />
Theirs not to wait their turn,<br />
Theirs not to reason learn,<br />
Theirs but to crash and burn:<br />
Into the Circle of Death<br />
Rode the six hundred.<br /></p>
<p>Bikers to right of them,<br />
Tourists to left of them,<br />
Golf carts in front of them<br />
Hurried and wonder'd;<br />
Storm'd at with horn and yell,<br />
Boldly they rode (not well),<br />
Into the roundabout,<br />
Into a great farewell<br />
Rode the six hundred.<br /></p>
<p>Flash'd all their signals bare,<br />
Flash'd as they turned in err,<br />
Scaring some students there,<br />
Hurrying to class, while<br />
All Stanford wonder'd:<br />
Plunged in the roundabout<br />
Crashed going wrong ways out;<br />
Tourist and student<br />
Reel'd from the total rout<br />
Shatter'd and sunder'd.<br />
Then they rode back, but not<br />
Not the six hundred.<br /></p>
<p>Bikers to right of them,<br />
Tourists to left of them,<br />
Golf carts behind them<br />
Hurried and wonder'd;<br />
Storm'd at with horn and yell,<br />
While friends and freshmen fell<br />
They that had biked so well<br />
Came thro' the roundabout,<br />
Back from a sure farewell,<br />
All that was left of them,<br />
Left of six hundred.<br /></p>
<p>When can their skid marks fade?<br />
O the wild ride they made!<br />
All Stanford wondered.<br />
Honour the ride they made,<br />
Honour the Bike Brigade,<br />
Noble six hundred.<br /></p>

<p>An article I wrote for the Stanford Flipside, but they ended up not using.</p>
<p>Stanford's Viennese Ball has long been known for its elegance and classiness, but a group of attendees are requesting that this year, the organizers bring twerking to the event, as part of an attempt to modernize the festivities.</p>
<p>Many dancers are embracing this movement, including Richard Powers, the renowned social dance instructor. &ldquo;At first, I wasn't sure how seriously to take these students,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but they've really shown their twerk, and now I understand the thrust of their argument. Dance evolves in fascinating ways, shaking up old ideas, and twerking is no exception. If there's enough student interest, I can open a section of Dance 162, Living Traditions of Twerking, next fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The basic step is quite easy, actually,&rdquo; he demonstrated. &ldquo;Now, fake what you thought you saw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Flipside also reached out to a representative of the Viennese Ball planning committee, Ike Summergreen. He remarked, &ldquo;I'm not really sure what to think of it&hellip; I'm not a big fan of twerking, but if it gets more people to turn up at Viennese Ball, then that's good, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for the Flipside, we're all for this hip dance trend. Twerkers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your shame!</p>
<h2 id="black_friday"><a href="#black_friday">&ldquo;I'm Dreaming of a Black Friday&rdquo;</a></h2>
<p>(with apolgies to whoever wrote White Christmas)</p>
<p>I'm dreaming of a Black Friday&hellip;<br />
just like the ones I used to know,<br />
Where the best deals glisten,<br />
And children listen,<br />
To hear shoppers in a row&hellip;<br /></p>
<p>I'm dreaming of a Black Friday,<br />
with every dollar that I save,<br />
May you get a deal on that microwave,<br />
And may all your retailers be brave.<br /></p>
<p>I'm dreaming of a Black Friday,<br />
To put our corporations in the green,<br />
With consumers spending,<br />
and bankers lending,<br />
so that we live beyond our means&hellip;<br /></p>
<p>I'm dreaming of a Black Friday,<br />
with every cashier that's attacked,<br />
May your sales be plentiful and stacked,<br />
And may all your Fridays,<br />
all your Fridays,<br />
all your Fridays be black.</p>

<p>"My name's Kurt Osis. I'm twenty-six years old, and I, uh, teach statistics at a high school in Northern Virginia.</p>
<p>No, that excuse doesn't work anymore. Let me try again.</p>
<p>My name is Kurt Osis. I am twenty-six years old, and I am a data scientist for the CIA. It is my job to discover trends and anomalies in the petabytes of data that the CIA collects about the world each week. We've saved lives by finding patterns in the data that nobody else could.</p>
<p>So anyways, a few months ago, we really started to put the &lsquo;applied&rsquo; in applied statistics."</p>
<p>&lt;ominous music, cut&gt;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Osis, we have a &ndash; mission for you. You see, desperate times make for desperate measures, and if
the kernel falls to the Bayesians' plot&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lt;cut, screeching brakes&gt;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you didn't expect it, but&hellip; you're about to be an outlier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lt;gunshot, cut&gt;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been assigned Agent MLE as your partner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, I'm Emily! Like you, I used to be approximately normal. I did swimsuit modeling. Now, I do statistical modeling&hellip; let's go put the discreet back into discrete math.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lt;cut, explosion, chopper noises&gt;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about sQ's jackknife!?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be no use to you &ndash; your foolish model failed to predict me. You Americans never learn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lt;cut, music swells&gt;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think &ndash; did we just, um, share a moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lt;cut&gt;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don't tell me where the kernel is in the next thirty seconds, you're going to end up uniformly distributed across all of London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lt;cut, B-BOOM!&gt;</p>

<h2 id="peano_man"><a href="#peano_man">The Peano Man</a></h2>
<p>(with apologies to Billy Joel)</p>
<p>It's 4:00 on a Saturday.<br>
The normal group shuffles in.<br>
A man sitting next to me tells me<br>
That his thesis is awfully thin.</p>
<p>He says, &ldquo;Son, can you prove me a theorem<br>
I'm not really sure how it goes<br>
But it's sad and it's sweet and Gödel-incomplete,<br>
And it'd help me to find some zeroes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>La la la d/d(da).<br>
La la d/d(da) da dum&hellip;</p>
<p>Write us a proof, you're the Peano Man,<br>
Write us a proof tonight.<br>
Well, we're all in the mood for an axiom,<br>
And you make the logic all right&hellip;</p>
<p>Now John in ℚ-bar is a friend of mine.<br>
He proves things in ZFC.<br>
And he's quick with a claim or to look up a name,<br>
But there's someplace that he'd rather be<br>
He says, &ldquo;Joe, I believe I'm a corollary.&rdquo;<br>
As the smile ran away from his face.<br>
&ldquo;Well I'm sure that I could be a physicist,<br>
If I could get out of this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>La la la d/d(da).<br>
La la d/d(da) da dum&hellip;</p>
<p>Now Paul is a real function analyst,<br>
Who approaches his work with a knife,<br>
And he's talking with Davy, who's computin' sin(<i>a</i>*<i>b</i>)<br>
And probably will be for life.</p>
<p>And the undergrads all practice algebra,<br>
All proving what was to be shown,<br>
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call problem sets,<br>
But it's better than thinkin' alone.</p>
<p>Write us a proof, you're the Peano Man,<br>
Write us a proof tonight.<br>
Well, we're all in the mood for an axiom,<br>
And you make the logic all right&hellip;</p>
<p>It's a pretty good group for a Saturday,<br>
And the professor gives me a smile.<br>
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see<br>
To forget about math for a while.<br>
And the blackboard, it looks like a snowstorm,<br>
As lemmas and claims become clear,<br>
And they sit at their desks and look over their tests,<br>
And say, &ldquo;man, what are you doin' here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>La la la d/d(da).<br>
La la d/d(da) da dum&hellip;</p>
<p>Write us a proof, you're the Peano Man,<br>
Write us a proof tonight.<br>
Well, we're all in the mood for an axiom,<br>
And you make the logic all right&hellip;</p>

<p>A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.&hellip;</p>

<p>TSAR WARS, EPISODE VII: THE NORSE AWAKEN</p>
<p>Princess Anastasia has vanished. In her absence, the sinister RED GUARD has
risen from the ashes of the Russian Empire, and will not rest until Anastasia,
the last heir, has been destroyed.</p>

<p>With the support of FINLAND, General Carl
Mannerheim leads a brave RESISTANCE. He is desperate to find Anastasia and gain
her help in gaining independence for Scandinavia.</p>
<p>Mannerheim has sent his most
daring general on a secret mission to Moscow, where an old ally has discovered
a clue to Anastasia's whereabouts.&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="carry_ons"><a href="#carry_ons">Carry-Ons My Wayward Son</a></h2>
<p>(with apologies to Kansas)<br ></p>

<p>
Chorus:<br>
Carry-ons, my wayward son,<br>
just two pieces and you're done.<br>
If you can't pass that one test,<br>
don't you fly no-o more.</p>

<p>(&hellip;)</p>

<p>
Ah-hhh&hellip;<br>
Once I booked a flight despite this confusion,<br>
But my baggage wasn't just an illusion,<br>
I was checking in my luggage, but I brought too much.<br>
Though my eyes can see I've gone to the airport,<br>
Though my mind could think I don't need my passport,<br>
I hear the voices at the counter,<br>
I can hear them say,
</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>
Masquerading as a frequent flyer,<br>
Will not get your quota any higher,<br>
And if you claim to be a pilot,<br>
It surely means that you won't go.<br>
In another line that's moving so slowly,<br>
TSA makes us do things unholy,<br>
I put my baggage on the scanner,<br>
but I hear the agent say,
</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>
Carry-ons,<br>
You will have to remember,<br>
Carry-ons,<br>
Get your lunch from a vendor,<br>
Now your stomach isn't empty,<br>
Hope the plane waits for you.<br>
Carry-ons, my wayward son,<br>
just two pieces and you're done.<br>
If you can't pass that one test,<br>
don't you fly,<br>
don't you fly no mo-oooooooooooooooooooooore!</p>

<p>(&hellip;)</p>

<p>No more!</p>

<h2 id="scarif"><a href="#scarif">I shot up Scarif (but I did not use AT-ATs)</a></h2>
<p>(with apologies to Bob Marley)</p>

<p>
I shot up Scarif, but I did not use AT-ATs<br>
I shot up Scarif, but I did not use AT-ATs
</p>
<p>
All around the galaxy,<br>
They're trying to look for me-eee,<br>
They say they want to bring me in guilty,<br>
'Cause I shot an Imperial library,<br>
For that Imperial library, but I say&hellip;
</p>
<p>
I shot up Scarif, but I swear it's for the greater good,<br>
I shot up Scarif, 'cause the rebels were in the neighborhood.
</p>
<p>
Galen Erso always hated me,<br>
For what I don't know<br>
Every plan he designs for me<br>
He adds a kill switch before he goes,<br>
He adds a kill switch before he goes. I say&hellip;
</p>
<p>
I shot up Scarif, but I swear it's for the greater good,<br>
I shot up Scarif, but I swear it's for the greater good
</p>
<p>
Power came my way one day,<br>
And I started up the guns<br>
All of a sudden I see all of Rogue One,<br>
Aiming to bring me down,<br>
So I shot, I shot them down, and I say&hellip;
</p>
<p>
I shot up Scarif, but I did not get the Death Star's plans<br>
I shot up Scarif, but I did not get the Death Star's plans
</p>
Darth Vader got the better of me,<br>
And what is to be must be<br>
Every day the Rebellion knows more<br>
But one day the rebels will back down,<br>
Yes, one day the rebels will back down, so I say&hellip;
</p>
<p>
I shot up Scarif, but I did not use AT-ATs, oh no,<br>
I shot up Scarif, but I did not use AT-ATs, oh no
