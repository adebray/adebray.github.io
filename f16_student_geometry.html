	<b>Lagrangian fibrations and topological mirror symmetry</b>
	</p>
	<p>For decades, mathematicians have tried to come up with well-posed
	conjectures and theorems that reflect the idea of mirror symmetry coming
	from physics. The most intuitive picture involves finding a &ldquo;special&rdquo;
	Lagrangian torus fibration of a space <i>X</i>, then &ldquo;dualizing&rdquo; it to get a new
	space <i>Y</i> also built out of special Lagrangian tori: this gets tricky along
	the singularities of the fibration. As it turns out though, it is very
	hard to even find such a fibration, the existence of which has come to be
	known as &ldquo;SYZ conjecture.&rdquo; A more reasonable version of the theory
	requires the existence of any Lagrangian torus fibration (thus not
	necessarily special). We'll see why this is more reasonable and I'll draw
	a few torus fibrations.
	Not a technical talk.</p>

	<b>Surface Bundles, Blowups, and Symplectic Fixed Points</b>
	</p>
	<p>Invariants of symplectic manifolds are often difficult to calculate, and it can be useful to understand how
	they change under basic operations in the symplectic category. In joint work with Tim Perutz we describe, for a
	particular geometric situation, how an invariant of symplectomorphisms called fixed-point Floer cohomology
	changes under a blowup of the underlying symplectic manifold. This is an introductory talk; no knowledge of
	symplectic geometry is necessary.</p>
