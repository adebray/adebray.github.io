	<b>Lagrangian fibrations and topological mirror symmetry</b>
	</p>
	<p>For decades, mathematicians have tried to come up with well-posed
	conjectures and theorems that reflect the idea of mirror symmetry coming
	from physics. The most intuitive picture involves finding a &ldquo;special&rdquo;
	Lagrangian torus fibration of a space <i>X</i>, then &ldquo;dualizing&rdquo; it to get a new
	space <i>Y</i> also built out of special Lagrangian tori: this gets tricky along
	the singularities of the fibration. As it turns out though, it is very
	hard to even find such a fibration, the existence of which has come to be
	known as &ldquo;SYZ conjecture.&rdquo; A more reasonable version of the theory
	requires the existence of any Lagrangian torus fibration (thus not
	necessarily special). We'll see why this is more reasonable and I'll draw
	a few torus fibrations.
	Not a technical talk.</p>

	<b>Surface Bundles, Blowups, and Symplectic Fixed Points</b>
	</p>
	<p>Invariants of symplectic manifolds are often difficult to calculate, and it can be useful to understand how
	they change under basic operations in the symplectic category. In joint work with Tim Perutz we describe, for a
	particular geometric situation, how an invariant of symplectomorphisms called fixed-point Floer cohomology
	changes under a blowup of the underlying symplectic manifold. This is an introductory talk; no knowledge of
	symplectic geometry is necessary.</p>

	<p><b>Chern-Weil forms and abstract homotopy theory</b></p>
	<p>Let <i>G</i> be a Lie group with Lie algebra ùñå. Classically, Chern-Weil showed that invariant polynomials on
	ùñå give rise to characteristic classes (represented geometrically as differential forms) for principal
	<i>G</i>-bundles with connection. Much more recently, Freed-Hopkins showed that such Chern-Weil forms are in
	fact the only natural differential forms associated to principal <i>G</i>-bundles with connection. An
	interesting feature of their approach is that they use modern homotopy theory to formulate the problem, but the
	subsequent calculations use only classical ideas. I will rapidly explain the framework they set up, then
	describe as much of the proof as possible.</p>

	<p><b>Mirror symmetry for log Calabi-Yaus and combinatorial representation theory
	</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	Roughly speaking, a log Calabi-Yau is a space that comes equipped with a volume form in a natural way. Let
	<i>X</i> be an affine log CY. We can partially compactify <i>X</i> by adding divisors along which Œ© has a pole.
	The set of these divisors says a lot about <i>X</i>'s geometry &mdash; for a torus (the simplest example of a
	log CY) this set is just the cocharacter lattice. We can actually give this set a geometrically motivated
	multiplication rule too, which I hope not to get into. But this multiplication rule allows us to construct an
	algebra <i>A</i>, defined purely in terms of the geometry of <i>X</i>, and conjecturally <i>A</i> is the
	algebra of regular functions on the mirror to <i>X</i>. Viewed as a vector space, <i>A</i> naturally comes with
	a basis &mdash; the divisors we used to define it. So we get a canonical basis for the space of regular
	functions on <i>X</i>'s mirror. Many objects of interest to representation theorists (semi-simple groups, flag
	varieties, Grassmannians&hellip;) are nice partial compactifications of log CY's. This gives us a chance to use
	the machinery of log CY mirror symmetry to get results in rep theory. Maybe the most obvious application given
	what I've said so far is finding a canonical basis for irreducible representations of a group. I'll discuss
	this, as well as how this machinery reproduces cones that make combinatorial rep theorists feel warm and fuzzy
	inside (like the Gelfand-Tsetlin cone and the Knutson-Tao hive cone). All of the technology involved is a
	souped-up version of something from the world of toric varieties. I'll discuss things in this context as much
	as possible in an attempt to keep everything accessible.
