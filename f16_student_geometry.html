	<b>Lagrangian fibrations and topological mirror symmetry</b>
	</p>
	<p>For decades, mathematicians have tried to come up with well-posed
	conjectures and theorems that reflect the idea of mirror symmetry coming
	from physics. The most intuitive picture involves finding a &ldquo;special&rdquo;
	Lagrangian torus fibration of a space <i>X</i>, then &ldquo;dualizing&rdquo; it to get a new
	space <i>Y</i> also built out of special Lagrangian tori: this gets tricky along
	the singularities of the fibration. As it turns out though, it is very
	hard to even find such a fibration, the existence of which has come to be
	known as &ldquo;SYZ conjecture.&rdquo; A more reasonable version of the theory
	requires the existence of any Lagrangian torus fibration (thus not
	necessarily special). We'll see why this is more reasonable and I'll draw
	a few torus fibrations.
	Not a technical talk.</p>

	<b>Surface Bundles, Blowups, and Symplectic Fixed Points</b>
	</p>
	<p>Invariants of symplectic manifolds are often difficult to calculate, and it can be useful to understand how
	they change under basic operations in the symplectic category. In joint work with Tim Perutz we describe, for a
	particular geometric situation, how an invariant of symplectomorphisms called fixed-point Floer cohomology
	changes under a blowup of the underlying symplectic manifold. This is an introductory talk; no knowledge of
	symplectic geometry is necessary.</p>

	<p><b>Chern-Weil forms and abstract homotopy theory</b></p>
	<p>Let <i>G</i> be a Lie group with Lie algebra ùñå. Classically, Chern-Weil showed that invariant polynomials on
	ùñå give rise to characteristic classes (represented geometrically as differential forms) for principal
	<i>G</i>-bundles with connection. Much more recently, Freed-Hopkins showed that such Chern-Weil forms are in
	fact the only natural differential forms associated to principal <i>G</i>-bundles with connection. An
	interesting feature of their approach is that they use modern homotopy theory to formulate the problem, but the
	subsequent calculations use only classical ideas. I will rapidly explain the framework they set up, then
	describe as much of the proof as possible.</p>

	<p><b>Mirror symmetry for log Calabi-Yaus and combinatorial representation theory
	</b>
	</p>
	<p>
	Roughly speaking, a log Calabi-Yau is a space that comes equipped with a volume form in a natural way. Let
	<i>X</i> be an affine log CY. We can partially compactify <i>X</i> by adding divisors along which Œ© has a pole.
	The set of these divisors says a lot about <i>X</i>'s geometry &mdash; for a torus (the simplest example of a
	log CY) this set is just the cocharacter lattice. We can actually give this set a geometrically motivated
	multiplication rule too, which I hope not to get into. But this multiplication rule allows us to construct an
	algebra <i>A</i>, defined purely in terms of the geometry of <i>X</i>, and conjecturally <i>A</i> is the
	algebra of regular functions on the mirror to <i>X</i>. Viewed as a vector space, <i>A</i> naturally comes with
	a basis &mdash; the divisors we used to define it. So we get a canonical basis for the space of regular
	functions on <i>X</i>'s mirror. Many objects of interest to representation theorists (semi-simple groups, flag
	varieties, Grassmannians&hellip;) are nice partial compactifications of log CY's. This gives us a chance to use
	the machinery of log CY mirror symmetry to get results in rep theory. Maybe the most obvious application given
	what I've said so far is finding a canonical basis for irreducible representations of a group. I'll discuss
	this, as well as how this machinery reproduces cones that make combinatorial rep theorists feel warm and fuzzy
	inside (like the Gelfand-Tsetlin cone and the Knutson-Tao hive cone). All of the technology involved is a
	souped-up version of something from the world of toric varieties. I'll discuss things in this context as much
	as possible in an attempt to keep everything accessible.

	<p><b>An entr√©e into Dijkgraaf-Witten theory</b></p>
	<p>
	Dijkgraaf-Witten theory is a topological quantum field theory that‚Äôs relatively simple to define, exists in all
	dimensions, and lacks path-integral-related analytic issues. As such, it‚Äôs a great introduction to the many
	facets of TQFT. In this talk, I will discuss what a TQFT is from the mathematician‚Äôs perspective, define
	Dijkgraaf-Witten theory in this paradigm, and use it to shine light on some aspects of TQFT. No knowledge of
	physics is assumed.</p>

	<p><b>Fattening Phenomena in Mean Curvature Flow</b></p>
	<p>The mean curvature flow is a geometric evolution equation that evolves a hypersurface according to the
	gradient of the area functional. It has a weak formulation that allows for the consideration of singular
	solutions and mimics the notion of viscosity solution in PDE. In certain dimensions the existence of unstable
	stationary cones leads to non-uniqueness phenomena. We‚Äôll survey such non-uniqueness examples for the mean
	curvature flow in which an initially smooth hypersurface flows to a cone in finite time and then admits
	non-unique solutions for later times.</p>

		Introduction to Mirror Symmetry
	</p></b>
	<p>
	Two Calabi-Yau threefolds <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> are called <i>mirror manifolds</i> if type IIA string theory
	compactified on <i>X</i> and type IIB string theory compactified on <i>Y</i> yield the same physical theory. We
	will describe a rough mathematical principle that follows from mirror duality of <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>, and
	derive from this a relationship between the Hodge numbers of <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>. This is an introductory
	talk, with (almost) entirely mathematical content. Knowledge of physics is emphatically not required; all
	buzzwords above will be either defined or ignored.

		Theta functions with a little mirror symmetry
	</b></p>
	<p>
	Classical theta functions are a special class of holomorphic functions on <i>C<sup>g</sup></i> that are
	quasi-periodic with respect to a lattice. However, theta functions can also be viewed as sections of a line
	bundle on an abelian variety and by fixing a bit of data, a canonical basis can be obtained. Classically, the
	construction of canonical theta functions depended heavily on the group structure of abelian varieties, making
	generalizations difficult. We will look at how recent use of toric varieties and mirror symmetry have helped
	provide a generalized notion of theta functions to other varieties, namely K3 surfaces.

		Intro to Modular Representation Theory (and Homotopy Theory)
	</b></p>
	<p>
	In this talk, I will introduce and motivate the main objects of study in modular representation theory, which
	leads one to consider the stable module category. Perhaps surprisingly, one can do homotopy theory in this
	setting, as the stable module category has the structure of a stable model category. Therefore, there is a
	very rich interplay between modular representation theory and stable homotopy theory, which I will try to
	illustrate. In the spirit of Halloween, one of the ideas I will talk about is the notion of phantom maps.

		On Johnson's Description of Atiyah Invariant
	</b></p>
	<p>In &ldquo;Riemann surfaces and Spin Structures,&rdquo; M. Atiyah defined an invariant for spin structures on
	a closed oriented surface analytically. D. Johnson then realized this invariant topologically by giving a
	correspondence between spin structures and quadratic forms on homology. In this talk, we will go through this
	concrete construction and discuss some consequences in spin bordism.</p>
