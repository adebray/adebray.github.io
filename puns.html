<p>As hard times hit the jelly factory, executives found themselves in a jam, and ended up canning a
lot of workers, who would later describe the experience as &ldquo;jarring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hope that the next Mario Kart game has a course that's a scaled-down map of the Earth. Then,
there would be continental drift.</p>
<p>It's fun to imagine headlines of the future.<br />
&ldquo;Droid rage: robot goes berserk after power goes to its head. Charged with battery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If Maxwell's demon ever failed to do its job, then hell would freeze over!</p>
<p>This one time I borrowed a friend's teapot and somehow broke it and flooded the room. I was

<p>Do you think a class on the linguistics of swearing would have a coarse reader?<br />
(Or would it be a curse reader?)</p>
<p>I bet the craps table is a gambler's pair-a dice.</p>

&ldquo;I've got a sinking feeling about this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wonder if anyone's ever applied machine learning to discovering the optimal competitive Pokémon
strategy. There would of course be no shortage of training data.</p>
<p>Police were puzzled by a string of break-ins in which two shadowy figures broke into houses,
wrote sonnets on the walls, and then left&hellip; taking nothing.<br />
After they were caught, they explained that they were partners in rhyme.</p>
<p>If there were a snack bar in the basement of the computer science building, would it be called
Snack Overflow?</p>
<p>Working on the CS 229 problem set: &ldquo;Bad things happen when you lose track of μ. Wasn't
that, like, the entire point of Pokémon Red and Blue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A teacher who wanted to assign grades fairly in a multivariable calculus class might end up doing
some impartial differentiation.</p>
<p>I know a group of people who tried to teach themselves how to dye hair without any previous
experience. It ended up being the blond leading the blond.</p>
<p>I used to think that the Bengali word for color was 'barna,&rsquo; but it turned out to be
wrong.</p>

accidentally kicked a cholla cactus!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I take it he was a Tenderfoot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had noticed that the math department tends to order Chinese food at a lot of its events (e.g.
speaker series), and I never really knew why &#8201;&mdash;&#8201; until I learned about the Chinese
Remainder Theorem.</p>
<p>I once golfed with a man who brought a flask full of something fruity, and opened and drank it
all before teeing off at the third hole.<br />
He explained that it was his &ldquo;three-hole punch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why do Linux programmers make such bad statisticians?<br />
Because to them, there is no one normal distribution.</p>
<p>I love Vietnamese food, but I know nothing about the associated dining etiquette
&#8201;&mdash;&#8201; which means it's only a matter of time until I slip up and make a major pho

<p>Some people think that men's fashion ought to allow for handbags, and that otherwise it's too

If I had a parrot that could speak several different languages, I would name it Polly Glot.</p>
<p>The best part about gay weddings is that the wedding party is so well-groomed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, I guess you could sample ice cream at stores across the nation and see if the
algorithm could learn regional variations.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Man, I would have so much fun collecting that training data.&rdquo;<br />

<p>If you take heavy water and put it in the microwave, do you get hot 'n&rsquo; heavy water?</p>
<p>If there's ever a severe energy crisis in the future, some households might hoard sources of
energy and pass them from generation to generation. Such treasures would of course be known as the
Family Joules.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;so thankfully, after the tune-up, it was no longer flat.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I'm confused. Are you talking about your bike or your instrument?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While it's not quite the Axess of Evil, I think the redesign is a bit Axessive for not actually
changing anything meaningful.</p>
<p>From the first day of filming, when three people turned up to play the weatherman, it was clear
that his part had been overcast.</p>
<p>Apparently I view the Stanford course catalog through a Marxist lens, because it's class
conflicts as far as I can see.</p>
<p>Under the standard rules of the board game Go, how many possible games are there? I think it
would be reasonable to call this (very large) number the Go Cardinal.</p>
<p>I knew a guy who was very good at competitive sushi-eating; he won contest after contest. I guess
he was really on a roll. He told me that he was so successful because he had learned to just roll
with it.</p>
<p>Little boats ask their parents, &ldquo;do you believe in ferries?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If someone had a great wedding, would they say that it went off with a hitch?</p>
<p>I wonder if someone's ever considered making a startup exclusively for sharing pictures of snack
foods. I guess you would call it&hellip; SnapChaat.</p>
<p>Buying furniture is the best way to go on a great personal journey: in one afternoon you can
undergo shelf-discovery followed by shelf-doubt followed by shelf-acceptance, and finally
shelf-improvement leading to shelf-actualization.</p>
<p>I once knew a philosopher who liked to get drunk all the time. I asked him about it and he

Happy Independence Day, all!</p>
<p>Two weeks of touring with the Stanford Symphony Orchestra has been an incredible amount of fun,
but I'm so tired I think I might fall into a state of tour-por.</p>
<p>I know someone whose textbooks suddenly all fell apart while he was studying. He suddenly found
himself in a bit of a bind &#8201;&mdash;&#8201; but concluded it was bound to happen
eventually.</p>
<p>I once heard of a monk who was expelled from a monastery after the other monks made a laundry

<p>&ldquo;Why did you mark points off of my essay for the type of margin I used? It's completely
unjustified!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are some door locks which are extremely narrow, apparently as security measure so that
lockpickers only find slim pickings.</p>
<p>I bet the popular music scene in the Czech Republic has a lot of Prague Rock.</p>
<p>I wonder if there's a brand of Russian candy called Tsarburst.</p>

&ldquo;Yeah, you should call them and give them a pizza your mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know a man who claimed to be an expert at making omelets. When we discovered he was lying, he
really had egg on his face.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to have a Unix shell called Blue Shell, in which multithreading is
difficult to implement. Then, it would create race conditions, of course.</p>
<p>It seems that the best way to implement a just-in-time compiler is to procrastinate on the CS 143
assignments until shortly before they are due&hellip;</p>
<p>An apprentice to a very overweight baker might end up seeing him as a roll model.</p>
<p>If a marching band is playing in a parade, it might be useful to know how long the parade block
is, for purposes of timing and the like. I don't know if anyone's given this number a name, but I
suggest calling it the bandwidth.</p>
<p>The last time I played chess, I lost both of my bishops quickly, leading to defeat. I guess you
would call that a clerical error?</p>
<p>People who lockpick tend to be very quiet about it&hellip; so quiet, in fact, that when they're
picking you can hear a pin drop.</p>
<p>I had wondered why Bill seemed to be the only computer programmer in the entire Pokémon

<p>Why didn't Alban Berg write a piece called the Goldbach variations?</p>
<p>&ldquo;So how would you determine whether the set <i>S</i> is an open domain?&rdquo;<br />

<p>In particle physics, people refer to antiprotons, but can't you get the same semantic idea by
calling it a conton?</p>
<p>I'm glad I don't have to commute on a turnpike. Over time, such a journey would really take its

<p>I don't know very much about how rubber bands are classified, but it would be really cool if they

&ldquo;Don't worry. I'm sure he'll rise to the occasion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If one wants to get a job as a professor of computer science, it helps to do a lot of networking
in grad school.</p>
<p>The phrase &ldquo;groups of small order&rdquo; is kind of a mouthful if you're doing a lot of

<p>&ldquo;Your e-reader has such a tacky case&hellip; it just looks disgusting!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Did you just judge a Nook by its cover?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What do cryptographic hash functions have in common with cars? In order to have perfect security,
they need to be collision-resistant!</p>
<p>I've thought of a new half-baked business idea. How about a brand of snack crackers called
Wisecrackers, that have funny or witty sayings on them?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baby, I wish I were Galois over you, so I could lie on top of you in a field!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why do we fight fire with fire?<br />

<p>Movie crossover idea: Legally Bond.<br>

<p>If someone were battered to death with fruit, he could be considered beaten to a pulp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gandalf, there's something weird growing out of the top of your staff. Do you know what it

<p>A mad scientist who creates an earthquake machine probably doesn't understand the magnitude of

<p>Apparently, the polymer that would become Saran Wrap was discovered completely by accident. I

<p>Our physics final asserted that when building a reflecting telescope, the focal point of the lens
and the focal point of the mirror should coincide. Unfortunately, if you do that, the image is at

<p>As the supervillain unveiled his detergent-driven doomsday device, he crowed to his minions,
&ldquo;The Tide has turned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don't understand why the Department of the Interior's offices need to post hours. After all,
mathematically speaking, aren't they always open?</p>
<p>The determinant can be thought of as a function from the space of <i>n</i> x <i>n</i> matrices to
the reals, in which case its support is just the general linear group GL(<i>n</i>).<br />
So I guess that makes GL(<i>n</i>) a support group.</p>

&ldquo;I don't know; the scores aren't out yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be a lot of fun to open a pretzel shop which specialized in odd yet delicious seasonings

<p>After the events of Pokémon Red and Blue, it's safe to say that the research done at Silph Co.
