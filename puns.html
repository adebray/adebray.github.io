<p>Grammar is a dangerous subject to argue about; if you're in the wrong mood, it can get tense. These days, if asked about this topic, I usually decline, just in case.</p>

<p>How do you think American presidents came to terms with the 22nd Amendment?</p>
<p>Why should we teach revolutionaries trigonometry? Well, if we don't&hellip;<br />

	2. They'll join some mystical sec that says they're full of sin,<br />
	3. Their revolutionary speeches will go on longwinded tangents,<br />
	4. And finally, they'll get cot by the government.<br />
	5. In short, they'll be rebels without a cos.</p>

<p>Overseas shipping is a great example of a pier-to-pier communication network.</p>

<p>Did you know about the first potato that the Soviets launched into space? It was called Spudnik.</p>
<p>There has to be a good word for the process of wading through bibliographies, looking for more to read on a subject.<br />

<p>Why do you think Stravinsky used so many different time signatures in The Rite of Spring? Could it be that he was raising the bar, or to see how he measured up against other composers? I think it's pretty hard to beat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you skirting around this issue? It's time to ad-dress it fully, to stop being so clothes-minded!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was once a digital camera company that had a big tiff over what image file format they should use, and a lot of people were left with raw feelings.</p>
<p>Nepotism could be considered a form of relative morality.</p>
<p>Wow, I guess nobody expects the Dutch inquisition&hellip;</p>

<p>I knew someone who adopted an unorthodox wheat-free diet; it really went against the grain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything was so much better back when I still did ballet!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;That may be, but I think you're missing the pointe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Opticians never have trouble focusing. Chemists know how to concentrate. But this mathematician just can't seem to apply himself and study for finals&hellip;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you noticed that your voice gets almost an octave higher when you're trying to get my to buy something?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Of course; it's my sales pitch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew a Spanish programmer who always did auxiliary work in the early afternoon: lots of meetings, but never coding. He explained it was his CS-ta.</p>
<p>I want to catch an Onix and name it Monad: &ldquo;Monad used Bind! &hellip; Monad used Return!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew someone who spent more time on warmups than actual exercise. He claimed it was good for one's health, but I think he's stretching the truth.</p>

&ldquo;I'm going to be blunt here: you're missing the point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew someone who wasted an entire day trying to take pictures from a particular viewpoint. He said that, in hindsight, it was quite a timelapse of judgement.</p>
<p>Dress codes at high schools across the country have been getting more and more similar &#8201;&mdash;&#8201; is this an example of uniform convergence?</p>
<p>I went to a talk given by Don Knuth! He used an overhead projector to give the talk, presumably to make his thought process more transparent.</p>
<p>Do you think Pavarotti was ever stalked by the operazzi?</p>
<p>I drew a map of the climbing wall. It's to scale!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do your promotional materials get updated so many times each week?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;How else could I call it a frequent flyer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard it's pretty stressful working on the antigravity team. They don't take failure lightly over there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do the Haskell people have so many masquerade balls?&rdquo;<br />

<p>I know someone who was always ambivalent about learning to dance&hellip; but once she stopped dragging her feet, she found out she enjoyed it after all.</p>
<p>I was once on a subway train whose last stop was at that city's airport, making it a terminal station.</p>
<p>I'm probably taking a course on Haskell next quarter. I was worried about whether I would get a bad grade&hellip; until I realized the class is probably lazily evaluated.</p>
<p>I once met an organist who wanted to build an organ whose tuning was based on fundamental ratios of the circle. He pulled out all of the stops to make it happen, but in the end it was only a π-pe dream.</p>
<p>Whenever computer scientists play in the orchestra, they always keep asking the conductor whether <b><i>p</i></b> = <b><i>mp</i></b>.</p>
<p>I once heard of this weird ancient instrument that you play with your feet. It eventually fell out of popularity, making it a historical footnote.</p>

<p>Douglas Hofstadter once gave a talk about linguistic categories, with the idea that linguistic units give us categories of situations/contexts to which they apply.<br />
So at some point, Hofstadter must have come up with this concept and realized that it was important for him to share it with the world. This was his categorical imperative.</p>
<p>Has MacGyver ever used a hot glue gun to get himself out of a sticky situation? If so, I suppose he really stuck to his guns.</p>

&ldquo;You see, I like to live in the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went running with some CS theorists the other day. They told me they ran quickly, but it turned out I was able to keep up &#8201;&mdash;&#8201; they just meant they had polynomial run time.</p>
<p>Every time I try to trade for sheep in Settlers of Catan, I end up getting fleeced.</p>
<p>This whole Twitch Plays Pokémon thing has gotten so crazily popular &#8201;&mdash;&#8201; but I was following the Helix Fossil back when it was still underground.</p>
<p>So this one time in Warsaw a poor, mentally ill bureaucrat had to inspect every telephone pole in the city to determine whether the homegrown or imported ones needed a new waterproof coating.<br />
In other words, there was a bipolar Pole polling poles to determine whether to polish the Polish poles.</p>
<p>What a strange day it is today; for on Christmas day you get Christmas cards, and on your birthday you get birthday cards. But on V-day you certainly don't get a v-card&hellip;</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Flatland,&rdquo; whenever Mr Square tried to explain the third dimension to anyone, they angrily denied that it could exist. I guess one could say they got bent out of shape?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had intended to write a program to recognize and translate cursive handwriting, but then things weren't going according to script.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Does the International Journal of Podiatry publish articles with a lot of footnotes? And do journals of economics tend to prefer margin notes?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'm really tired. Is it OK if I take a quick nap in your chair?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Go ahead, knock yourself out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Recently, I put some bubble wrap on the wall outside my room for people to pop. People have begun added to the collection, so that people can always pop it when they're stressed.<br />
Yesterday, a big sheet of really good bubble wrap just&hellip; appeared. Does anyone know who put it there so I can thank them?<br />
It's been a long time since I've felt this pop-ular.</p>
<p>When I, long ago, learned that the Nutcracker suite was written to be danced to, I said, &ldquo;Aha! That is why there are so many movements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a friend who chases diagrams in much the same way that he chases women: by figuring out how they commute, and then carefully following them down every possible path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm addicted to sending letters through the mail. It started out as a regular expression of my appreciation of my friends, but it's reached a state where the mailman is rejecting my letters until I finally decide to halt and function more normally.<br />
&rdquo;In short, I recognize that I have a post correspondence problem, and it's time for me to accept that."</p>
<p>If you wanted to determine how hot the average Berkeley student was, would you use a Cal-orimeter?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know why all the faucets in the music building bathrooms are so oddly spaced?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I think it's because they're sink-opated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Have you heard the one about the gold-digging pedophile who was always attracted to miners?</p>
<p>Has there ever been a bakery in Salinas Valley called Yeast of Eden?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that a date palm, or are those just fronds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If a bunch of male authors banded together and bought a boat, could one call it a penmanship?</p>
<p>¿Si yo lucho con mi trabajo, soy tareador?</p>
<p>Corporate executives are like wizards: if you have a good enough staff, it's OK if you don't know how to spell.</p>
<p>Would a particularly innovative way of beginning construction of a building be considered groundbreaking?</p>
<p>So this one time I tried my hand at web design and HTML, but I ended up being really out of my element.</p>
<p>I once heard of some spies who used a code language that didn't distinguish between active and passive voice. I guess that's why they called themselves secret agents.</p>
<p>I once heard of two prolific criminals who somehow never said anything during a heist. Even when caught by the police, they confessed with hand gestures and facial expressions.<br />
Anyways, I guess they're locked in a very real box now, but before that they were partners in mime.</p>
<p>I recently got a phone charger that came with several twist-ties to help organize the mess of cables around my power outlet. I thought it was awfully cordial of them to help battle the discord that usually goes on there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you, um, go rock climbing as a way of meeting women? That's pretty unusual. How often do you end up getting belayed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That song, much like a salad, could really benefit by throwing in some beats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Today I saw two people who had started a chess game, made six or seven moves each, and then got distracted by their phones. It was a classic example of arrested development.</p>
<p>Would a philosophical treatise on looking at ships be considered naval-gazing?</p>
<p>I've always had a hard time drawing fish accurately, perhaps because I have no sense of scale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know why the third floor of this building's so much larger than the second?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Um, that's kind of a long story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, I appreciate you baking the bread instead of me for once, but how incompetent do you have to be to get the crust on the inside!?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Don't you see? it's a roll reversal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In The Wizard of Oz, the coroner of Munchkin Land is seen examining the Wicked Witch of the East, but never bills anyone for his time, which is weird because I guess it's his job. Do you think that, this time only, it was on the house?</p>
<p>Backpacking isn't a competitive sport; it's just relaxing and fun. It would be so weird to see televised college backpacking competitions, with announcers reporting the latest Pack-12 results&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you're saying&hellip; we have the same shoe size, and we both really like the taste of flatfish. Does that make us sole mates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I feel like there's a lot more gossip about romance and potential couples around the holidays. Do you think people are making use of free shipping?</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sees you when you're sleeping, he knows when you're awake&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Oh my gosh, Santa's&hellip; stocking me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, we don't need to divide up Grandfather's pet rabbits in the will. You're splitting hares!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I guess journalists tend to have pressing concerns.</p>
<p>I wonder how much hip-hop is produced in Budapest. It could be a great Hungarian rap city.</p>
<p>It could be a lot of fun to doodle on the backs of playing cards. Though I guess they're not well suited to being decked out.</p>
<p>I once knew someone who always gave people alarm clocks on their birthdays, explaining that &ldquo;there's no present like the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If a traveler has to change planes in Kuala Lampur, would that be considered a Malayover?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ew, why are you still using Helvetica? Get with the Times, man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To all those of you with open-book CS finals this week, I hope that you pass by reference!</p>
<p>Apparently, I have a vested interest in investing in some kinds of formal outerwear.</p>
<p>I suppose that rock-climbing courses taught at universities are a form of higher education.</p>
<p>I now understand why people like murder-mystery themed dinners so much. The food is to die for, and in the end everyone gets their just desserts!</p>
