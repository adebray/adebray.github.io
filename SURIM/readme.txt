My name is Arun Debray, and I am a Stanford undergraduate in the class of
2015. I worked on a summer research project called the Stanford Under-
graduate Research Instiitute in Mathematics, and I have typeset some
notes I have.

In order to read these notes, you can download main.pdf, where they are
all compiled in a book. If you want to compile the .tex files yourself,
download the following files:
abeliandecomp.tex
classnumbers.tex
cohen.tex
datamining.tex
diffgeo.tex
doodle.tex
exact.tex
factoring.tex
fileio.tex
formula.tex
gametheory.tex
geology.tex
grouptheory.tex
grouptheory2.tex
hopf.tex
idealstuff.tex
la.tex
linear2.tex
linearrecurrences.tex
main.tex
mentor.tex
minkowski.tex
morer.tex
pde.tex
presentation.tex
quadraticfields.tex
quadraticreciprocity.tex
rcontrol.tex
sage.tex
shapeofdata.tex
skolem.tex
statspresent.tex
surimpreamble.tex
svd.tex
unix.tex
unix2.tex
useful.tex
Triangular_point_lattice.png
clustering.png
cyclic.png
lattice2.png

Alternatively, this can be done more easily with the file
adebray_surim.zip.

Then, open a command line, navigate to the directory in which you saved
these files, and type
pdflatex main
and you should be set. In order to get the table of contents and links
right, it may be necessary to run this two or three times.

If you do not have LaTeX installed, the notes will not compile, but the
pdf will still be usable.

Questions, comments, complaints, and corrections are welcome at
adebray at stanford.edu.
