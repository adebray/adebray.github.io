<h2> The Long Shortlist of Classical Music </h2>

I've told more than one person that I would list them the pieces I most enjoyed. I guess the most efficient way to do that is to just list everything. This is a work in progress. Suggestions are welcome.
<h3> Orchestral </h3>
<h4> Symphonies and Suites </h4>
<ul>
<li> Mozart wrote some good symphonies. I'll have to figure this out.
<li> Same with Haydn.
<li> Beethoven wrote nine symphonies, and they are all top-notch. Of course, some are better than others, and I recommend 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
<li> Hector Berlioz, <i>Symphonie Fantastique</i>. This piece is known for its incredible orchestration, but also for its story, which comes across particularly well. The symphony depicts Berlioz's love for an actress, Harriet Smithson; the theme representing her (called the <i>id&eacute;e fixe</i>) is important in every movement, though its purpose changes. The passionate first movement depicts their first meeting, and the glittering second shows a dance. But the pastoral third mixes beauty and despair, leading to two movements that are much less happy: in the fourth, the composer imagines his own execution for murder, and in the fifth, his beloved is seen as a witch. Some of this may have been inspired by adventures with heroin, too.<br>
But the most amazing thing about this symphony, composed as a love song, was that it <i>worked</i>, and eventually Berlioz and Smithson married. (Well, for a few years.)
<li> Tchaikovsky wrote six symphonies, and his Nos. 5 and 6 are among my favorite symphonies ever.
<li> Rmsky-Korsakov wrote delightful, colorful, orchestral suites: I am particularly fond of <i>Capriccio Espagnol</i> and <i>Scheherezade</i>.
<li> Mussorgsky's <i>Pictures at an Exhibition</i>, though originally written for piano, was given a spectacular orchestration by Ravel.
<li> <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVakXOkE2G4'>Vasily Kalinnikov: Symphony No. 1</a>: beautiful yet somehow poorly-known Romantic symphony. His second symphony is also worth investigation.
<li> Mahler wrote nine symphonies, though many non-horn players don't really like his music. My experiences with Nos. 1 and 5 have been very positive.
<li> Stravinsky's famous ballet suites are wonderful. <i>The Firebird</i>, <i>Petrushka</i>, and <i>The Rite of Spring</i> did unprecedented (and in many ways still unmatched) things to usher in modernism, all while remaining genuinely enjoyable pieces of music. There's so much to listen for here.
<li> Dmitri Shostakovich wrote fifteen symphonies, of which his Fifth is best known and loved. Many of his symphonies told two stories simultaneously: one interpretation supported the Soviet government, and another might struggle against it. The emotions flowing through the Fifth are at times exciting, heartbreaking, and completely ambiguous.
<li> Along with his symphonies, Shostakovich wrote two jazz suites that are upbeat and animated.
<li> Ravel's <i>Daphnis et Chloe</i> suite.
<li> Aaron Copland wrote music with a distinct American feel. I particularly like <i>Appalacian Spring</i>.
<li> Phillip Glass did some interesting things with minimalism, and produced a suite called <i>Glassworks</i>.
</ul>
<h4>Concertos</h4>
This will include double concertos, etc., and also some pieces that aren't called concertos but feature a soloist along with the orchestra, as long as they aren't part of larger works. If your instrument is missing, that's most likely out of ignorance of any good concertos, and I would welcome suggestions.
<h5> Violin </h5>
I'm not the biggest fan of violin concertos, possibly because of the range. But the exceptions are worth listening to.
<h5> Cello </h5>
<h5> Clarinet </h5>
<h5> Oboe </h5>
<h5> Bassoon </h5>
Yes, of course this one will be the longest section.
<h5> Trumpet </h5>
<ul>
	<li> Haydn and Hummel both wrote nice classical trumpet concertos. Hummel's in particular is notable for being one of the first for chrmoatic trumpet.
	<li> Alexander Arutiunian (Ալեքսանդր Հարությունյան), an Armenian modernist composer, wrote a flashy, energetic concerto.
</ul>
<h5> French horn </h5>
<h5> Marimba </h5>
<h5> Piano </h5>
<h4> Overtures and Other Short Works</h4>

<h3> Wind Ensemble </h3>

<h3> Chamber </h3>
<h4> Woodwind Quintets </h4>
Wind quintets tend to be either late Classical or very modern. I'll try to list the classical ones first. Links to be added.
<ul>
<li> Giuseppe Cambini wrote three excellent wind quintets.
<li> Danzi wrote nine.
<li> Reicha wrote twenty-four, totalling possibly ten to twelve hours of quintet music!
<li> Moving into modernism, Samuel Barler (best known for <i>Adagio for Strings</i>) wrote a wind quintet called <i>Summer Music</i>. It's not as dissonant as stereotypically modern music, but it's still refreshingly different from the quintets I listed above.
<li> Darius Milhaud wrote a nice suite called <i>Le Cheminee du Roi Renee</i>.
<li> Jean Fran&ccedil;aix has written two; both are good, but I like the first better. It was once described to me as "circus music on crack," and is a lot of fun for the musicians.
<li> Malcolm Arnold, <i>Three Shanties</i>. In this suite, Arnold takes three shanties you may have heard and has a lot of fun with them. It's been described as more fun for the musicians than the audience, but I still find myself enjoying listening.
<li> Nielsen's quintet. I enjoy the fact that the closing note requires the bassoonist to play a low A, which is normally impossible. Since the clarinet doesn't play the last note, its bell can be removed and placed at the top of the bassoon to get the correct note.
<li> Ligeti, <i>Sechs Bagatellen f&uuml;r Bl&auml;serquintett</i> (<i>Six Bagatelles for Wind Quintet</i>). This is an arrangement of six movements from his also wonderful <i>Musica Ricercata</i>. These are much more tonally adventurous than anything else you'll find here, so if that's not your thing you may not like some of these movements. Tht said, the third movement is beautiful no matter one's stance on dissonance.
<li> Hindemith, <i>Kleine Kammermusik</i>. Also not conventionally tonal, but good nonetheless.
</ul>
<h4> Other </h4>
To be added. There are lots of other worthwhile chamber works, even ones that don't have a bassoon in them.
